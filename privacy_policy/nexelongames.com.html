If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as by adding a statement to our homepage or mobile applications or by sending you an email notification). We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access the Services to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy.<br>[terms]<br>The Site is owned and operated, or in some cases licensed, by NEXELON Inc. and its affiliates (\"NEXELON,\" \"we,\" \"us\" or \"our\"). USE OF THE SITE, USE OF NEXELON'S APPLICATIONS (as defined in Section 1 below) OR REGISTRATION ON THE SITE CONSTITUTES YOUR CONSENT TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS OF USE (\"Terms\"). THESE TERMS MAY BE AMENDED FROM TIME TO TIME; THE TERMS ALSO INCLUDE OUR PRIVACY POLICY AND OTHER LEGAL NOTICES, WHICH ARE INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS, DO NOT USE ANY SITE, NEXELON'S APPLICATIONS OR ANY SERVICES AVAILABLE VIA ANY SITE.<br>If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the Site or NEXELON's Applications.<br>1. Ownership. The Site and our mobile applications, our online applications, all content, services and functionality associated with our mobile and online applications, and certain functionality on the Site (collectively, \"Applications\") are the exclusive property of NEXELON and\/or its suppliers. All rights not granted herein are reserved by NEXELON. From time to time, we may offer you the ability to use Applications, but any and all such usage and offers to use the Applications are subject at all times to these Terms and the licenses NEXELON grants to you.<br>2. Grant of License. So long as you comply with these Terms, we grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, terminable license to view and use the Site and Applications only for entertainment purposes.<br>The licenses granted to you are conditioned upon your proper conduct and compliance with these Terms at all times, as judged by NEXELON in its sole discretion and judgment. We reserve the right to suspend or deny, in our sole discretion, your access to all or any portion of the Site or any Application.<br>This license allows you to download and\/or purchase content (including, but not limited to, virtual currency, collectively referred to as \"Virtual Currency\" in these Terms and in-Application virtual content), as well as access information and Applications. You may also post, upload and distribute content to and through the Site and the Applications in accordance with these Terms.<br>You do not own the Virtual Currency that you purchase or the content that you acquire in the Applications in exchange for Virtual Currency (\"Virtual Items\"); you instead have a license to use the Virtual Currency in the Applications. Any Virtual Currency balance shown in your in-Application account or other account on a Site does not constitute a real-world balance or reflect any stored value, but rather indicates the extent of your limited license to use Virtual Currency in the Applications. NEXELON prohibit and does not recognize any purported transfer of Virtual Currency or Virtual Items effected outside of the Applications. Accordingly, you may not sublicense, trade, sell or attempt to sell or exchange Virtual Currency or Virtual Items for real money or other value of any kind outside of an Application. Any such transfer or attempted transfer is prohibited and void, and will result in the termination of your license to use the Site and the Applications.<br>3. License Limitations; Prohibited Conduct. The licenses granted to you will be revoked (with or without notice) and ineffective if you:<br>(a) are under age 13 or if you are between the ages of 14 and 17 and have not obtained the consent of your parent or legal guardian;<br>(b) use any robot, spider, bot or other automatic device or manual process to monitor or copy any portion of a Site or the Applications without our prior written permission;<br>(c) use any device, software or routine to damage, over-burden or impair the Site or any Applications, which includes the use of a jail-broken or rooted device or tool that enables the operation of the Site or an Application in a manner that is other than what we intended;<br>(d) take any action that imposes an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure or interferes with any other user's ability to use or access the Site or any Application;<br>(e) copy, reproduce, alter, modify, transfer, lease, loan, sell, create derivative works, or publicly display any Application or content from the Site or a portion of an Application or the Site;<br>(f) alter or modify the copyright notices and any other proprietary legends that appear on the Site or any Application;<br>(g) access the Site by any means other than through the public interfaces we provide to you;<br>h) are located in a country embargoes by the United States or if you are on the U.S. Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals;<br>(i) have previously had your license to the Site and\/or Applications revoked by NEXELON;<br>(j) engage in any act that NEXELON deems to be in conflict with the spirit or intent of these Terms, the Site or the Applications, including, but not limited to, circumventing or manipulating these Terms, our game rules, game mechanics or policies;<br>(k) make improper use of NEXELON's customer service or other support services, including by submitting false reports or using profane and abusive language in your communications with any NEXELON employee or representative; or<br>(l) fail to comply with any of the provisions of these Terms.<br>Our Applications and the Site are not intended for use by children under age 13 or persons who have not reached the age of majority under the laws of the applicable jurisdiction. Although most Applications are free to download, some in-Application content, functionality and actions are available only by purchasing of Virtual Currency or content with real money. If you are a parent, legal guardian and other adult responsible for children in your care, you are fully responsible for any use of your credit card or other payment instrument by the children in your care. Parents and other adults who provide our Applications to their children, children in their care or other adults should take precautions to prevent unintended purchases of Virtual Currency or other in-Application content. For example, in the Android operating system environment, you should delete your credit card information in advance of providing your device that includes any Application to anyone. We accept ABSOLUTELY NO RETURNS on any Virtual Currency or Virtual Items purchases, including those made by children (minors) in your care.<br>NEXELON assumes no liability for purchase errors, trial versions, software purchased for the wrong telephone, device or platform, promotion codes or discounts not provided at the time of purchase or any purchased item for any reason (\"Purchaser Errors\").
