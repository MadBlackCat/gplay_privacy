 <div class="content-inner">
<p><strong>How do ad identifiers, cookies, and similar technologies work? </strong>
 </p>
<p>Ad identifiers are non-permanent identifiers such as the Android advertising ID and/or Apple's ID for advertising (the ‘IDFA’), which are uniquely associated with your device. Similar technologies include tracking pixels within ads. Cookies are small text files that are stored by your browser on your desktop computer or mobile device. </p>
<p>When you access the Service, we collect certain technical information in order to (i) analyze the usage of our sites and Service; (ii) provide a more personalized experience; and (iii) manage advertising. We and service providers acting on our behalf, such as Google Analytics, will use Log Files and other tracking technologies to collect and analyze certain types of technical information over time and across different websites following your use of the Service, including cookies, WiFi information, IP addresses, geo-location, device type, device identifiers, browser types, browser language, referring and exit pages, and URLs, platform type, the number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, Service state and the date and time of activity on our Services, and other similar information. In some cases, we will associate this information with your user ID number for our internal use. Our Service currently does not respond to "Do Not Track" (DNT) settings in your web browser and operates as described in this Privacy Policy whether or not a DNT signal is received. If we do so in the future, we will describe how we do so in this Privacy Policy. For further details regarding DNT, visit donottrack.us.

<p>We also employ other technologies including (i) web beacons, which allow us to know if a certain page was visited or whether an e-mail was opened; (ii) tracking pixels, which allow us to advertise more efficiently by excluding our current users from certain promotional messages, identifying the source of a new installation or delivering ads to you on other websites; and (iii) local shared objects also known as flash cookies, which help us to prevent fraud, remember your in-Service preferences and speed up load times.

<p><a name="section3a"></a><strong>How to adjust your preferences for interest-based advertising</strong>
 </p>
<p>You can choose to prevent your device's ad identifier being used for interest-based advertising, or you can reset your device's ad identifier, by changing the settings of your device. Settings vary from device to device but you will usually find the ad identifier settings under "privacy" or "ads" in your device's settings.
 </p>
<p>You can set your web browser to warn you about attempts to place cookies on your computer or limit the type of cookies you allow. Flash cookies operate differently than browser cookies and cookie management tools available in a web browser may not remove flash cookies. To learn more about and manage flash cookies you can visit adobe.com and make changes at the privacy settings panel. If you disable cookies, you may lose some of the features and functionality of playing our Services, as cookies are necessary to track and enhance your Service activities. Please note that companies delivering advertisements in our Services or on our websites may also use cookies or other technologies, and those practices are subject to their own policies.
 </p>
<p>We also use Google Analytics, who uses cookies to help the website analyze how users use the Service and enhance your experience when you use the Service.

 </p>
<p>We will use information collected from you in any one or more of the following ways:</p>
<ul><li>To create your Service accounts and allow access to our Services;
 </li><li>To identify and suggest connections with other users;
 </li><li>To enable user-to-user communications;

 </li><li>To engage in commonly accepted practices, such as contacting you at the email address we have on file if you are a potential winner in a sweepstakes; and
 </li><li>To improve and develop our products and Services.
 </li></ul>
<p>One important use of your information is communication. If you have provided your e-mail address to us, we’ll use it to respond to (i) customer support inquiries, (ii) keep you informed of your in-Service activity, including comments from friends, notifications about in-Service status and requests, and (iii) provide you with details of our similar games or Services, unless you have asked us to stop sending you our marketing material or opted out from our electronic marketing communications. Some messages, such as invites for friends to join you in a Service, may include your name and profile photo. If you are not a current user, we will send promotional e-mail messages and promotional messages directly or in partnership with third parties only if you have provided your prior consent in accordance with the relevant laws and regulations for us to do so.
 </p>
<p><strong>Marketing </strong></p>
<p>We may use the information we hold about you to promote our Services in any one of the following ways:

<p>We use information about you to try to make sure you only see marketing from us that might be of interest to you, including:
 </p>
<ul><li>ad identifiers and other information collected from your device. For more information, see <a href="#section3">Ad identifiers, cookies and similar technologies</a> ;

 </li></ul><p><strong>Opting out of direct marketing from us</strong>
 </p>
<p>You can exercise choices over the direct marketing we send you in the following ways:
 </p>
<ul><li>you can withhold your consent for us to send you direct marketing emails by opting out when we collect your email address or by electing not to share your email address with us when you first create an account using your Facebook details;
 </li><li>you can remove yourself from receiving email marketing from us at any time by simply clicking the unsubscribe link in any direct marketing email we send to you or sending an email to <a href="mailto:support@mobilewar-online.com"><strong>support@mobilewar-online.com</strong></a>; and

 </p>
<p><strong>Third Parties’ Direct Marketing</strong></p>
<p>We do not share personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless you affirmatively agree to such disclosure, typically by "opting in" to receive information from a third party that is participating in a sweepstakes or other promotion on one of our sites. If you do ask us to share your personal information with a third party for its marketing purposes, we will only share information in connection with that specific promotion, as we do not share information with any third party (other than our service providers) on a continual basis. To prevent disclosure of your personal information for use in direct marketing by a third party, do not opt in to such use when you provide personal information on one of our sites.
 </p>
<p>Your access to the Services will not be affected if you do not "opt in" to receive information from such third parties. </p>
<p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the "Shine The Light" law, permits our customers who are California residents to request and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, information about the personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year. If applicable, this information would include a list of the categories of personal information that was shared and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to: Customer Service c/o Mobile War LLC, 1390 Market St., Ste 200, San Francisco, CA 94102-5404.
