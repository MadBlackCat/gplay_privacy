Policy</h1><h2>Introduction</h2><p>This is the Privacy Policy of MOVEFAST COMPANY ("Company") and its live streaming broadcast service HAKUNA
("Service") and is incorporated into and is subject to our TERMS OF SERVICE which can be found at
<a href="https://hakuna.live/terms-of-service">https://hakuna.live/terms-of-service</a>. Please read on to learn more about our data handling practices. Your use of
the Service signifies that you agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with the terms
of this Privacy Policy, you may not use the Service and must immediately terminate your use of the Service.</p><h2>Information we collect</h2><p>When you install the software for using the Service ("Application") on your device and register with the
Service, personally identifiable information about you may be collected during the download process of the
Application for the Service (as requested from you during the download process). For registration through the
Service, you are required to provide your mobile phone number or your email address, city location, gender,
name, depending on the device(s) you are using for the Service. You may also provide additional information, but
that is optional. When you log in using your Facebook or Google account, we may collect additional information
you make available to us (please see "Your User Profile" below).</p><p>The Service may also collect and gather non-personally identifiable information, such as certain profile
information including country of residence and preferences. In addition, the Service may collect and store
information about your and others' usage of and interaction with the Service and our websites, including usage
by geographies, device and connection information, IP address, device capability, bandwidth, statistics on live
streaming views, network type and traffic to and from our websites.</p><p>The Service allows you to share text messages, photos, screenshots, videos and other communications in the
Service with other users, and if you choose to do so. In addition, if you choose to share these items with other
Service users, we may not be able to remove them from our servers or make them unavailable to anyone you have
shared them with. Sending and sharing text messages, photos, screenshots, videos or other communications in the
Service is your decision. By choosing to share that information, you should understand that you may no longer be
able to control how that information is used and that it may become publicly available (depending in part on
your actions or the actions of others with whom you have shared the information). The Service is not responsible
for any use or misuse of information you share.</p><p>The Service may also collect and gather user contents (e.g. photos, screenshots, comments, and other materials)
that you create on the Service. Your photo can be taken by other users on the Service, and if they use capturing
function provided by the Service, those photos can be stored and used for the Service and 3rd party's service
(e.g. Facebook, etc.). If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, you may not use the Service
and must immediately terminate your use of the Service.</p><p>To complete a commerce transaction on the item shop of the Service, you will be requested to provide your
payment information, including your credit card number, card expiration date, CVV (Card Verification Value)
code, and billing address. In that event, we will transmit your information securely directly to a third-party
vendor or merchant who will collect such information in order to process and fulfill your purchase. We do not
process or store your payment information. However, we may store other information about your purchases made on
the Service, which may include the merchant's name, the date, time and amount of the transaction and other
behavioral information.</p><p>We also collect error-reporting information if the Service crashes or hangs up so that we can investigate the
error and improve the stability of the Service for future releases. In general, these reports do not contain
personally identifiable information. As part of these error reports, we receive information about the type and
version of your device, the device identifier, the time the error occurred, the feature being used and the state
of the Application when the error occurred. We do not use this information for any purpose other than
investigating and fixing the error.</p><h2>Sharing of your information</h2><p>We will not rent or sell your information to third parties (or the group of companies of which the Company is a
part) without your consent, except as noted in this Privacy Policy.</p><h2>Parties with whom we may share your information</h2><ul><li><p>We may share your information (including, but not limited to, information from cookies, log files, device
identifiers, location data, and usage data) with businesses that are legally part of the same group of

Affiliates may use this information to help provide, understand, and improve the Service (including by
providing analytics) and Affiliates' own services (including by providing you with better and more relevant
experiences). But these Affiliates will honor the choices you make about who can see your contents.</p></li><li><p>We also may share your information as well as information from tools like cookies, log files, and device
identifiers and location data, with third-party organizations that help us provide the Service to you
("Service Providers"). Our Service Providers will be given access to your information as is reasonably
necessary to provide the Service under reasonable confidentiality terms.</p></li><li><p>We may also share aggregate or anonymous information with third parties, including advertisers and investors.
For example, we may tell our advertisers the number of users our Application receives. This information does
not contain any personal or personally identifiable information and is used to develop contents and services
that we hope you will find of interest.</p></li><li><p>We may remove parts of data that can identify you and share anonymized data with other parties. We may also
combine your information with other information in a way that it is no longer associated with you and share
that aggregated information.</p></li></ul><h2>Parties with whom you may choose to share your contents</h2><ul><li><p>Any information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Service ("User Contents") may
become available to the public. Once you have shared User Contents or made it public, that User Contents may
