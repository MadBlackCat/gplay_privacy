    <p><strong><br>
    <br>
    4. How We May Disclose Your Information</strong><br>
      Third-party Websites, Social Media Platforms, and Software Development Kits</p>
    <p>We may share your information as described in this Privacy Policy (to provide the Services with our Third-party Service Providers; to comply with legal obligations; to protect and defend our rights and property) or with your consent.</p>
    <p>Service Providers. We may share any information we receive with Service Providers. The types of Service Providers (processors) to whom we entrust Personal Information include Service Providers for: (i) provision of IT and related services; (ii) provision of information and services you have requested; (iii) payment processing; (iv) customer service activities; and (v) in connection with the provision of the Services. Zuuks Games has executed appropriate contracts with the Service Providers that prohibit them from using or sharing Personal Information except as necessary to perform the contracted services on our behalf or to comply with applicable legal requirements.<br>
      Business Partners. Zuuks Games may share Personal Information with our Business Partners and affiliates for our and our affiliates’ internal business purposes or to provide you with the Services that you have requested. Zuuks Games may also provide Personal Information to Business Partners with whom we may jointly offer products or Services. In such cases, our business partner’s name will appear, along with Zuuks Games. Zuuks Games requires our affiliates and Business Partners to agree in writing to maintain the confidentiality and security of Personal Information they maintain on our behalf and not to use it for any purpose other than the purpose for which Zuuks Games provided them.<br>
      Displaying to Friends and Other Users.  Our Services support you to interact with other players. If you play our games through a social network or register through a social network (for example, Facebook Connect), your social network friends will see your name, profile photo and descriptions of your game activity. Similarly, other players, regardless of whether they are your social network friends or not, will be able to see descriptions of your game activity, communicate with you within our Services if you use the chat feature of our games and view your game profile, which may include your name or a “game name” and your profile photo. In certain cases, your profile photo can reveal your social network ID or player ID, and access to a social network ID or player ID may allow others to view the public information associated with your related social network profile or the game account. Also, the content you post may be displayed in the chat feature of the Games. We are not responsible for privacy practices of the other users who will view and use the posted information.<br>
      Marketing - Interest-based or Targeted Advertising and Third-party Marketing. Through our Services, Zuuks Games may allow Third-party advertising partners to set tracking tools (e.g., Cookies) to collect the following information within our Services:<br>
      performance data (like the number of clicks on an advertisement);<br>
      certain technical information (for example, IP addresses, non-persistent device identifiers such as Advertising ID and de-identified persistent device identifiers such as a hashed Android ID);<br>
      your social network ID;<br>
      other contextual data about your game play (for example, your level and session length); and<br>
      pseudonymous data, not directly identifying information (e.g., OS name and versions, device models, time stamp).<br>
      These advertising partners may use this information (and similar information collected from other websites) to measure how effective ads are for delivering targeted advertisements to you about our games within their networks. This practice is commonly referred to as “interest-based or targeted advertising.” We may allow access to other data collected by the Services to facilitate transmittal of information that may be useful, relevant, valuable or otherwise of interest to you.</p>
    <p>Disclosures to Protect Us or Others (e.g., as Required by Law and Similar Disclosures).

      In addition, from time to time, server logs may be reviewed for security purposes—e.g., to detect unauthorized activity on the Services. In such cases, server log data containing IP addresses may be shared with law enforcement bodies, so they may identify users in connection with their investigation of the unauthorized activities.</p>
    <p>Merger, Sale, or Other Asset Transfers. If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, financing due diligence, reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, sale of company assets or transition of service to another provider, then your information may be sold or transferred as part of such a transaction as permitted by law and/or contract. In such event, Zuuks Games will endeavor to direct the transferee to use Personal Information in a manner that is consistent with the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such Personal Information was collected.<br>
      <br>
      <strong><br>

      <strong>7. Rights of Access, Rectification, Erasure, and Restriction</strong><br>
      You have the right to request access to and rectification or erasure of Personal Information or restriction of processing, the right to object and the right to data portability.</p>
    <p>The general right to object applies to all types of processing described in this Privacy Policy. Unlike the right to object against processing for direct marketing purposes, we are only obliged to follow an objection if you state specific grounds relating to your particular situation.</p>
    <p>When otherwise permitted by applicable law, you can open a support ticket within the Games or, alternatively, send an e-mail to help@zuuks.com to request access to, receive (port), seek rectification or request erasure of Personal Information held about you by Zuuks Games. Please include your full name, user identifier, the email address associated with your account and a detailed description of your data request. Such requests will be processed in line with applicable laws.</p>
    <p>Although Zuuks Games makes good faith efforts to provide Individuals with access to their Personal Information, there may be circumstances in which Zuuks Games is unable to provide access, including but not limited to when the information contains legal privilege, would compromise others’ privacy or other legitimate rights, when the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the Individual’s privacy in the case in question or when it is commercially proprietary. If Zuuks Games determines that access should be restricted in any particular instance, we will provide you with an explanation of why that determination has been made and a contact point for any further inquiries. To protect your privacy, Zuuks Games will take commercially reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access to or making any changes to your Personal Information.</p>
