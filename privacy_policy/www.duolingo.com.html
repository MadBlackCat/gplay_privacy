(“<strong>Duolingo</strong>”, “<strong>we</strong>”, “<strong>us</strong>” or “<strong>our</strong>”) receives about you, how we process it and your rights and obligations in relation to your personal data. Duolingo, Inc., a company registered at 5900 Penn Ave, Second Floor, Pittsburgh, PA 15206, United States of America is the data controller for the purposes of the General Data Protection Regulation (“<strong>GDPR</strong>”) and any relevant local legislation (“<strong>Data Protection Laws</strong>”).</p><p>By using or accessing the Service, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. Capitalized terms not defined here have the meanings set forth in the terms and conditions (the “<strong>Terms and Conditions</strong>”), located at <a href="/terms">www.duolingo.com/terms</a>. We may update our Privacy Policy to reflect changes to our information practices. If we do this and the changes are material, we will post a notice that we have made changes to this Privacy Policy on the Website for at least 7 days before the changes are made, and we will indicate the date these terms were last revised at the bottom of the Privacy Policy. Any revisions to this Privacy Policy will become effective at the end of that 7 day period.</p><p>If you are an employee, worker or contractor of Duolingo, the information about how we handle your personal information is available in the Duolingo internal knowledge base.

For example, we may share your information in order to detect where or how you encountered a bug when using our mobile application. In connection with these operations, our service providers will have access to personal data for a limited time. When we utilize service providers for processing any personal data, we implement contractual protections limiting the use of that personal data to the provision of services to Duolingo.</p><p>We will be required to access and disclose personal data in response to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws. Additionally, we will access and share account or other personal data when we believe it is necessary to comply with law, to protect our interests or property, to prevent fraud or other illegal activity perpetrated through the Service or using the Duolingo name, or to prevent imminent harm.

Information associated with the Duolingo English Test, including examination results and your Testing Video, will be collectively deleted from your Duolingo account after five years have passed from the date you upload your test, but anonymized examination data, including your examination results and Testing Video, will be kept indefinitely by Duolingo to improve the examination and for research and analysis.</p><p>Please note that some of these rights are not absolute. In some cases, we may refuse a request to exercise particular rights if complying with it meant that we are no longer able to meet our contractual obligation to provide you with particular products and services. We will keep you informed as to the actions that we can take when you make your request.</p><p>You may also have the right to make a GDPR complaint to the relevant Supervisory Authority. A list of Supervisory Authorities is available here: <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm">http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm</a>. If you need further assistance regarding your rights, please contact us using the contact information provided below and we will consider your request in accordance with applicable law. In some cases our ability to uphold these rights for you may depend upon our obligations to process personal information for security, safety, fraud prevention reasons, compliance with regulatory or legal requirements, or because processing is necessary to deliver the services you have requested. Where this is the case, we will inform you of specific details in response to your request.</p></li><li><h3>Third party websites and links</h3><p>Please note that you may have cookies placed on your computer by third party websites that refer you to our Service.

Duolingo uses age-gating to restrict what services are available to children depending on the age of the user and the applicable laws of their country. For example, a 15 year old child in Germany will require parental consent to use the Service, whereas a 12 year old child in the United States of America would receive a restricted service but not require parental consent.</p><h4>Children within the European Union</h4><p>Each European Union (EU) member state is permitted to legally define its own digital age of consent between 13 and 16. Duolingo checks the age and country of the user to determine if the user is able to consent to the Service. If consent of a parent/guardian is required, the user will input the e-mail address of an adult who will receive a request to approve the child’s account registration. In the absence of a country specific Act of Law, the age of consent will be set at 16.</p><p>These EU child users will receive the following service restrictions: they will not be able to use the service until their parent/guardian has provided consent for the child to do so. After the parent/guardian has given consent, they child will be allowed to access the full Duolingo service.</p><p>Where Duolingo does make features and services available to children, we recognize that collecting personal data from children requires further privacy protections. Accordingly, Duolingo will: (1) notify parents or guardians about Duolingo’s privacy and information practices regarding children, including what personal data we collection and how we use, share, and protect that personal data; (2) limit our collection of personal data to ensure that we collect no more than is necessary to provide Duolingo’s services; (3) obtain parental consent before collecting personal data from children; and (4) allow parents to request that Duolingo change or delete personal data about their children.</p><h4>Children outside of the European Union</h4><p>If a child of under 13 years from outside the EU registers for the Duolingo service, upon registration the child will provide an adult’s e-mail address, to whom Duolingo sends a notification.</p><p>These child users will receive the following service restrictions:</p><ul><li>Instead of any Personally Identifiable Information about the child, we will only store the e-mail address of their parent/guardian.</li><li>Only family friendly advertisements are shown and these ads do not do behavioral tracking.</li><li>Mature words such as "beer" and "wine" are disabled.</li><li>Social features are disabled, e.g. profiles, forums, clubs, etc.</li><li>They can not enter profile information such as a profile picture or a bio.</li></ul><p>At the point when the user is known to have reached the age of 13, the account will automatically be transitioned to be a normal non-restricted account.</p><p>At all times Duolingo does not knowingly collect personal information from children in connection with the Service. If we discover that we have unknowingly collected personal information from these children, we will delete it. If you believe we have collected personal information from a child, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@duolingo.com">privacy@duolingo.com</a>.</p></li><li><h3>Links</h3><p>The Service may contain links to other websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other websites. We encourage users to be aware when they leave the Service to read the privacy statements of other websites that collect personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected by Duolingo via the Service.</p></li><li><h3>Information security</h3><p>Duolingo has implemented administrative and technical safeguards it believes are appropriate to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of your personal data, Testing ID, User Photo, access credentials, and Duolingo English Test results. However, given sufficient resources, a determined attacker could defeat those safeguards and may, as a result, gain access to the data we seek to protect.</p></li><li><h3>Do Not Track</h3><p>The Service is not designed to respond to “do not track” signals sent by some browsers.</p></li><li><h3>Contact Us</h3><p>Duolingo’s headquarters are located within the USA at:<br>Duolingo, Inc.<br>5900
