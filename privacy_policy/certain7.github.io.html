This may be in the form of email, post, SMS, telephone or targeted online advertisements. We limit direct marketing to a reasonable and proportionate level, and to send you communications which we think will be interesting and relevant to you, based on the information we have about you.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For the purposes of GDPR our processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes is based on our legitimate interests (as further detailed in applicable Appendix), but where opt-in consent is required by the relevant laws such as the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations of Europe, we may ask you for your consent. You have a right to stop receiving direct marketing at any time.

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">6. International transfers</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We may transfer your personal data to affiliate companies or service providers that are located inside or outside of Europe. We may also share your personal data overseas, for example if we receive a legal or regulatory request from a foreign law enforcement body. We will always take steps to ensure that any international transfer of information is carefully managed to protect your rights and interests:</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s2">鈥淎</span><span class="s1">utomated decision making</span><span class="s2">鈥漴</span><span class="s1">efers to a decision which is taken though the automated processing of your personal data alone. This means processing using, for example, software code or an algorithm, which does not involve any human intervention. As profiling uses automated processing, it is sometimes connected with automated decision making. Not all profiling results in automated decision making, but it can do.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If you are a consumer that has signed up to receive marketing updates, we may use profiling to ensure that marketing materials are tailored to your preferences and to what we think you will be interested in. This does not have any significant effect, or a legal effect on you. In certain circumstances it may be possible to infer certain information about you from the result of profiling, which may include special categories of data. We will not however conduct profiling based on your special categories of data unless we have obtained your explicit consent to do so.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">PLEASE NOTE:&nbsp;You have certain rights in respect of automated decision making, including profiling where that decision has significant effects on you, including where it produces a legal effect on you. See Section 9.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">8. How long do we keep your personal data?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We will retain your personal data for as long as is reasonably necessary for the purposes listed in Section 3 and relevant Appendixes of this Policy. In some circumstances we may retain your personal data for longer periods of time, for example where we are required to do so to meet legal, regulatory, tax or accounting requirements.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In specific circumstances we may also retain your personal data for longer periods of time so that we have an accurate record of your dealings with us in the event of any complaints or challenges, or if we reasonably believe there is a possibility of legal action relating to your personal data or dealings. Where your personal data is no longer required we will ensure it is either securely deleted or stored in a way which means it will no longer be used by the business.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">9. What are your rights?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">You have a number of rights in relation to your personal data. In summary, you may request access to your data, rectification of any mistakes in our files, erasure of records where no longer required, restriction on the processing of your data, objection to the processing of your data, data portability and various information in relation to any automated decision making and profiling or the basis for international transfers.
