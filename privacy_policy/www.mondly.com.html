            through your Web
            browser (if you allow) that enables the site's or service provider's systems to recognize your browser and
            capture and
            remember certain information. For instance, we use cookies to help us remember and process the items in your

        <p>This does not include website hosting partners and other parties who assist us in operating our website,
            conducting our business,

        </p>
        <p>We may also release information when its release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site
            policies, or protect

        <p>We use Google AdSense Advertising on our website.</p>

        <p>Google, as a third-party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on our site. Google's use of the DART cookie

        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <p>We, along with third-party vendors such as Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics
            cookies) and third-party
            cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) or other third-party identifiers together to compile data regarding
            user interactions
            with ad impressions and other ad service functions as they relate to our website.</p>

        <h2>California Online Privacy Protection Act</h2>
        <p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a
            privacy policy.
            The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and
            conceivably
            the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers
            to post a
            conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those
            individuals or companies
            with whom it is being shared. - See more at: <a href="http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf">http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</a>

        <h2>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h2>
        <p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the
            Children's Online
            Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States'
            consumer protection
            agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to
            protect children's
            privacy and safety online.</p>

        <h2>CAN-SPAM Act</h2>
        <p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial
            messages, gives
            recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for
            violations.
        </p>
        <p>We collect your email address in order to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Market to our mailing list or continue to send emails to our clients after the original transaction has
                occurred.
            </li>
            <li>Authorize and authenticate you as a user of our services and provide additional functionality such as
                tracking your purchases,
                providing access to additional content and your progress within the application
            </li>
        </ul>


        <p>
            To be in accordance with CAN-SPAM, we agree to the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Not use false or misleading subjects or email addresses.</li>
            <li>Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way.</li>
            <li>Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters.</li>
            <li>Monitor third-party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used.</li>
            <li>Honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly.</li>
            <li>Allow users to unsubscribe by using the link at the bottom of each email.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, you can follow the instructions at
            the bottom
            of each email and we will promptly remove you from all correspondence.</p>
