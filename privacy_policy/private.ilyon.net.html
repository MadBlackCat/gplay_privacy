A list of these partners is available at <a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://private.ilyon.net/ilyon-third-parties/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">private.ILYON.net/ilyon-third-parties</a>.

<h2>Cookies and similar technologies</h2>
<p>Like most online services, we and our partners use cookies and similar technologies to provide and personalize the Service, analyze use, target advertisements and prevent fraud. You can disable or delete any existing cookies in your browser settings, but some parts of the Service may then not function properly.</p>
<p>Each browser is different, so check the “Help” menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences. Cookies are browser specific; thus, if you use multiple devices or web browsers to access Ilyon Games and Services, you will need to manage your cookies preferences across these various devices and browsers. If you are using a mobile device to access Ilyon’s Games and/or Services, please refer to your instruction manual or other help/settings resource to find out how you can control cookies on your device. </p>
<p>By changing your device settings, you can prevent your device’s ad identifier being used for interest-based advertising, or you can reset your device’s ad identifier. Typically, you can find the ad identifier settings under “privacy” or “ads” in your device’s settings, although settings may vary from device to device.</p>
<p>Adjusting your preferences as described in this section does not mean you will no longer receive advertisements, it only means the advertisement you do see will be less relevant to your interests. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We do not control the use of cookies by third parties. Please refer to the privacy policies of each of the third party advertising and analytics providers for more information on third-party cookies.</p>
<h2>How do we protect your data</h2>
