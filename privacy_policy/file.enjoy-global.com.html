<h2 id="toc_0">Terms of Use Agreement and Privacy Policy</h2>

<h3 id="toc_1">Terms of Use Agreement</h3>

<p>Welcome to Filmigo (“Filmigo”, ”we” or ”us”).This page explains the terms by which you may use our application, service through your brower or mobile device(collectively our “App”).By downloading, accessing or using the App, you signify that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this Terms of Use Agreement and to the collection and use of your information as set forth in the Filmigo Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>Filmigo reserves the right to make unilateral modifications to these terms. This Agreement applies to all visitors, users, and others who download, access or use the App(“Users”).</p>

<p>PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY TO ENSURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND EACH PROVISION. THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS A MANDATORY ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES PROVISION. YOU AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND Filmigo WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION.</p>

<h4 id="toc_2">1.Use of Our App</h4>

<p>Filmigo provides an App for you to create personal video by sequencing your photos or other videos, and if you choose, to add music, narration, or other sound to accompany your video.</p>

<h5 id="toc_3">(1)Eligibility</h5>

<p>You may use the App only if you can form a binding contract with Filmigo, and only in compliance with this Agreement and all applicable local, national, and international laws, rules and regulations. The App is not available to any Users previously removed from the App by Filmigo.</p>

<h5 id="toc_4">(2)Filmigo App</h5>

<p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you are hereby granted a non-exclusive, limited, non-transferable, freely revocable license to use the App for your personal, private, noncommercial use, and only in accordance with the features of the App as it is marketed by Filmigo. Filmigo reserves all rights not expressly granted herein in the App and the Filmigo IP . Filmigo may terminate this license at any time for any reason or no reason.</p>

<p>You may not use the Filmigo App for commercial purposes unless you are the copyright holder or you have obtained all necessary rights and licenses to use for commercial purposes all videos and other material that make up your User Content.</p>

<h5 id="toc_5">(3)Filmigo Accounts</h5>

<p>Your Filmigo account gives you access to the App and functionality that we may establish and maintain from time to time and in our sole discretion. By connecting to Filmigo with a third-party service, you give us permission to access and use your information from that service as permitted by that service, and to store your log-in credentials for that service.</p>

<p>You may never use another User’s account without permission. When creating your account, you must provide accurate and complete information. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your account, and you must keep your account password secure. We encourage you to use “strong” passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols) with your account. You must notify Filmigo immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account. Filmigo will not be liable for any losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account.</p>

<p>You may control your User profile and how you interact with the App by changing the settings in the mobile app. By providing Filmigo your email address you consent to our using the email address to send you App-related notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail. We may also use your email address to send you other messages, such as changes to features of the App and special offers.</p>

<h5 id="toc_6">(4)Usage Rules</h5>

<p>You agree not to engage in any of the following prohibited activities: (i) copying, distributing, or disclosing any part of the App in any medium, including without limitation by any automated or non-automated “scraping”; (ii) using any automated system, including without limitation “robots,” “spiders,” “offline readers,” etc., to access the App in a manner that sends more request messages to the Filmigo servers than a human can reasonably produce in the same period of time by using a conventional on-line web browser; (iii) transmitting spam, chain letters, or other unsolicited email; (iv) attempting to interfere with, compromise the system integrity or security or decipher any transmissions to or from the servers running the App; (v) taking any action that imposes, or may impose at our sole discretion an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure; (vi) uploading invalid data, viruses, worms, or other software agents through the App; (vii) collecting or harvesting any personally identifiable information, including account names, from the App; (viii) using the App for any commercial purposes without having all necessary rights and licenses to the User Content; (ix) impersonating another person or otherwise misrepresenting your affiliation with a person or entity, conducting fraud, hiding or attempting to hide your identity; (x) interfering with the proper working of the App; (xi) accessing any content on the App through any technology or means other than those capabilities provided by the App; or (xii) bypassing the measures we may use to prevent or restrict access to the App, including without limitation features that prevent or restrict use or copying of any content or enforce limitations on use of the App or the content therein.</p>

<p>We may, without prior notice, change the App, stop providing the App or features of the App, to you or to Users generally, or create usage limits for the App. We may permanently or temporarily terminate or suspend your access to the App, or delete any User Content (as defined below), without notice and liability for any reason, including if in our sole determination you violate any provision of this Agreement, or for no reason. Upon termination for any reason or no reason, you continue to be bound by this Agreement.</p>

<p>You are solely responsible for your conduct and any data, text, files, information, images, photos and video clips, sound recordings, musical works, narration, works of authorship, links and other content or materials that you submit, post or display on or via our App. Filmigo shall have no liability for conduct in relation to your use of our App.</p>

<h4 id="toc_7">2.User Content</h4>

<p>Some areas of the App provide Users the capability to create, share and post content such as profile information, photographs, videos, images, musical works, sound recording, narration, text and other material used to create a Filmigo, comments, questions, and other material or information (any such materials a User provides, shares, submits, displays, or otherwise creates using the App, including the Filmigo created by the User, are “User Content”). We claim no ownership rights over User Content created by you. Filmigo has the right (but not the obligation) in its sole discretion to remove any User Content that is stored via the App.</p>

<p>You agree not to post, store, transmit, create or share any User Content that: (i) may create a risk of harm, loss, physical or mental injury, emotional distress, death, disability, disfigurement, or physical or mental illness to you, to any other person, or to any animal; (ii) may create a risk of any other loss or damage to any person or property; (iii) seeks to harm or exploit children by exposing them to inappropriate content, asking for personally identifiable details or otherwise; (iv) may constitute or contribute to a crime or tort; (v) contains any information or content that we deem to be unlawful, harmful, abusive, racially or ethnically offensive, defamatory, infringing, invasive of personal privacy or publicity rights, harassing, humiliating to other people (publicly or otherwise), libelous, threatening, profane, or otherwise objectionable; (vi) contains any information or content that is illegal (including, without limitation, the disclosure of insider information under securities law or of another party’s trade secrets); or (vii) contains any information or content that you do not have a right to make available under any law or under contractual or fiduciary relationships. You agree that any User Content that you create, store, or share does not and will not violate third-party rights of any kind, including without limitation any Intellectual Property Rights (as defined below) or rights of privacy. Filmigo reserves the right, but is not obligated, to reject and/or remove any User Content that Filmigo believes, in its sole discretion, violates these provisions.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this Agreement, “Intellectual Property Rights” means all patent rights, copyright rights, mask work rights, moral rights, rights of publicity, trademark, trade dress and service mark rights, goodwill, trade secret rights and other intellectual property rights as may now exist or hereafter come into existence, and all applications therefore and registrations, renewals and extensions thereof, under the laws of any state, country, territory or other jurisdiction.</p>

<p>In connection with your User Content, you affirm, represent and warrant the following:</p>

<p>Your User Content and your use thereof as contemplated by this Agreement and the App will not violate any law or infringe any rights of any third party, including but not limited to any Intellectual Property Rights or privacy rights.</p>

<p>To the extent that you use our App for any commercial purpose and your User Content contains any copyrighted material that is not your original work or in which you do not otherwise own the copyright, you have obtained all rights, licenses, consents, and permissions necessary in order to use that copyrighted material in connection with the creation and/or dissemination of that User Content using the App.</p>

<p>Filmigo may exercise the rights to your User Content granted under this Agreement without liability for payment of any guild fees, residuals, payments, fees, or royalties payable under any collective bargaining agreement or otherwise. Filmigo takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any User Content that you or any other User or third party creates, stores, shares, posts or sends through the App. You shall be solely responsible for your User Content and the consequences of posting, publishing it, or sharing it and you agree that we are only acting as a passive conduit for your online distribution and publication of your User Content. If your Content violates these Terms of Use, you may bear legal responsibility for that content.</p>

<h4 id="toc_8">3.User Content License Grant</h4>
