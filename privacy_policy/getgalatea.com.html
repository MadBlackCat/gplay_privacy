<p>We may use this data to customize content for you that we think you might like, based on your usage patterns.&nbsp; We may also use it to improve the Services – for example, this data can tell us how often users use a particular feature of the Services, and we can use that knowledge to make the Services interesting to as many users as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Will Galatea Share Any of the Personal Information it Receives?</strong></p>
<p>We do not rent or sell your Personal Information in personally identifiable form to anyone. We may share your Personal Information with third parties as described in this section:</p>
<p><strong>Information that’s been de-identified.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>We may de-identify your Personal Information so that you are not identified as an individual, and provide that information to our partners. We may also provide aggregate usage information to our partners (or allow partners to collect that information from you), who may use such information to understand how often and in what ways people use our Services, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal online experience. However, we never disclose aggregate usage or de-identified information to a partner (or allow a partner to collect such information) in a manner that would identify you as an individual person.</p>
<p><strong>Affiliated Businesses:</strong>&nbsp;In certain situations, businesses or third party websites we’re affiliated with may sell or provide products or services to you through or in connection with the Services (either alone or jointly with us).&nbsp; You can recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service, and we will share your Personal Information with that affiliated business only to the extent that it is related to such transaction or service. We have no control over the policies and practices of third party websites or businesses as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to take part in any transaction or service relating to an affiliated website or business, please review all such business’ or websites’ policies.</p>
<p><strong>Agents:</strong>&nbsp;We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you; for example, we may use an analytics company to provide us with insights about your use of the Services. &nbsp;Unless we tell you differently, our agents do not have any right to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. Note that an “agent” may also be considered a “partner” in certain circumstances, and would be subject to the terms of the “<strong>Information that’s been de-identified</strong>” section in that regard.</p>
<p><strong>User Profiles and Submissions:</strong><em>&nbsp;</em>Certain user profile information, including your name may be displayed to other users. Your account privacy settings may allow you to limit the other users who can see the Personal Information in your user profile and/or what information in your user profile is visible to others.&nbsp; Please remember that any content you upload to your public user profile, along with any Personal Information or content that you voluntarily disclose online in a manner other users can view (e.g. comment sections) becomes publicly available, and can be collected and used by anyone.&nbsp; Your username may also be displayed to other users if and when you make comments through the Services.</p>
<p><strong>Business Transfers:</strong>&nbsp;We may choose to buy or sell assets, and may share and/or transfer customer information in connection with the evaluation of and entry into such transactions.<em>&nbsp;</em>Also, if we (or our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, Personal Information could be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party.</p>
<p><strong>Protection of Company and Others:</strong>&nbsp;We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information that we reasonably believe is necessary to comply with law or court order; enforce or apply our&nbsp;<a href="https://getgalatea.wordpress.com/terms/">Terms of Use</a>&nbsp;and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Company, our employees, our users, or others.</p>
<p><strong>Is Personal Information about me secure?</strong></p>
<p>You must prevent unauthorized access to the device through which you access the Services and your Personal Information by limiting access to your device.</p>
<p>We endeavor to protect the privacy of your account and other Personal Information we hold in our records, but unfortunately, we cannot guarantee complete security. &nbsp;Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time.</p>
<p><strong>What Personal Information can I access?</strong></p>
<p>Through your account settings, you may access, and, in some cases, edit or delete the information you’ve provided to us.</p>
<p>The information you can view, update, and delete may change as the Services change.&nbsp; If you have any questions about viewing or updating information we have on file about you, please contact us at support@inkitt.com.</p>
<p><strong>What choices do I have?</strong></p>
<p>You can always opt not to disclose information to us, but keep in mind some information may be needed to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features.</p>
<p>You may be able to add, update, or delete information as explained above.&nbsp; When you update information, however, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records.&nbsp; You may request deletion of your account by emailing support@inkitt.com. Some information may remain in our records after your deletion of such information from your account. We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally.</p>
<p><strong>What if I have questions about this policy?</strong></p>
<p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding our privacy policies, please send us a detailed message to support@inkitt.com, and we will try to resolve your concerns.</p>
<h3 class="western"><strong>EU RESIDENTS</strong></h3>
<p>If you are a resident of the European Union (“EU”), United Kingdom, Lichtenstein, Norway, or Iceland, you may have additional rights under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) with respect to your Personal Data, as outlined below.</p>

<p><strong>What Security Measures Do We Use? &nbsp;</strong>We seek to protect Personal Data using appropriate technical and organizational measures based on the type of Personal Data and applicable processing activity.
