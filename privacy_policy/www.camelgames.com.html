Games's products, services and sites may employ cookies and other technologies

that can be transferred to a user's hard drive to customize a person's use of a
product or online site, keep records of a user's access to an online site or
product, or store information needed by the user on a regular basis. Use of
cookies is typically associated with websites. For example, when you sign in to
Camel, Camel Games stores your user id and a combination of your IP address and
time of login as a cookie on your hard drive. This cookie allows you to move
from page to page without having to sign in again on each page. Similarly, if
you enter information during your session, such as age verification data, this
will be stored as a cookie and you will not have to re-enter such information
during that session. We may also use third party web site analytic tools that
employ cookies to collect certain non-personally identifiable information
concerning use of our websites, such as referring web site addresses, page
views and browser types.</span></p>

Camel Games software automatically generates and submits to Camel Games bug
reports upon a crash or other fault in the Camel Games software, services or
Camel games. This automatically generated bug report information may include
information about other software or hardware on a user's system. Camel Games
