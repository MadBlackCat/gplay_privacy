                        <p>We may share your booking information, account information, device information, and location information with affiliate companies within our corporate family and third parties, such as the partners detailed below, to ensure the successful provision of services to you. Our partners include the following types:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Providers:</b> including but not limited to hotels, airlines, cruise lines, car rental agencies, travel agencies, scenic spot operators, and event providers and agents that meet your booking needs. These providers may contact you as needed to provide you with travel products or services. These providers are not controlled by Trip.com and personal information disclosed to them is subject to the applicable provider's privacy statement and security practices. Therefore, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of any travel provider whose products you purchase through Trip.com.</li>
                            <li><b>Third party vendors:</b> We may work with third party vendors under contract to us to provide services or functions on our behalf, including credit card processing, business analytics, customer service, marketing, distribution of surveys or sweepstakes, and fraud prevention. We may also authorize third-party vendors to collect information on our behalf, including information necessary for us to operate the features of our website or to facilitate the delivery of online advertising tailored to your interests. Third-party vendors have access to and may collect information only as needed to perform their functions and are not permitted to share or use the information for any other purpose.</li>
                            <li><b>Financial institutions and third-party payment agencies:</b> When you place a booking, apply for a refund, or purchase insurance, we will share the related information with the relevant financial institutions or the third-party payment agencies, and as we believe is necessary for fraud detection and prevention, we will further share other necessary information (i.e. email address, phone number, and IP address) with the relevant financial institutions.</li>
                            <li><b>Business partners:</b> with whom we may jointly offer products or services, or whose products or services may be offered on our websites or apps. You may tell when a third party is involved in a product or service you have requested because their name will appear, either alone or with ours. If you choose to access these optional products or services, we may share information about you, including your personal information, with those partners. Please note that we do not control the privacy practices of these third-party business partners.</li>
                            <li><b>Affiliated companies within our corporate family:</b> We may share your personal information with our affiliated companies so that we best provide you with the requested service as well as information about other travel-related products and services.

                </ul>

After the deletion, we will no longer collect, use, or share any personal information related to this account.</p>
				<p>You can request that we delete your personal information if you no longer want us to use your information to provide Services to you.</p>
                <p>In addition, you can request access to your personal information, request that any inaccuracies be corrected, and request that comments or explanations be added to records about you.

                <p>Finally, you can ask us not to collect or use your personal information for certain purposes, or you can ask us to either refrain from sharing your information with, or specifically ask that we do not provide your personal information to, a third party.</p>
                <p>The rights listed above may not apply in all cases. For example, if you ask us to delete information which we are required by law to keep or have compelling legitimate interests in keeping, we may not be able to delete all of your personal information, in which case we will inform you of the relevant exceptions.</p>
                <p>We will respond to your above requests without undue delay. Trip.com reserves the right to take reasonable steps to verify customer identity before taking further action on your request.</p>

                <ul style="list-style: none;">
                    <li>•	The specific data privacy complaint (please provide as much detail as possible including country, your understanding of the data privacy infringement, and redress requested);</li>
                    <li>•	Your full name and how we can contact you;</li>

				<h2 id="use-of-this-website-by-children-">Use of This Website by Children</h2>
				<p>This website is not intended for anyone under the age of 16 years old. If you are under 16, you may not register with, or use this website. </p>

                <h2 id="special-category-of-personal-information-">Special Category of Personal Information </h2>
                <p>In connection with fulfilling your travel requests for disability considerations and dietary preferences, some information you provide us may be considered as “special category” personal information. Any processing of such information by Trip.com is based on the consent you grant at the time of collection.</p>

                <h2 id="using-trip-com-mobile-phone-and-tablet-apps-">Using Trip.com Mobile Phone and Tablet Apps</h2>
                <p>When you use either the mobile phone or tablet apps of Trip.com (herein collectively referred to as the “Mobile App”), we collect and use information about you in the same way and for the same purposes as we do when you use our website.</p>
                <p>In addition to this, we also use some other information that we collect automatically when you use our Mobile App. Specifically:</p>
                <ul style="list-style: none;">
                    <li>•	We collect information about Mobile App functionality based on what parts of the Mobile App you access and use. This allows us to identify those areas of the Mobile App that are of interest to our customers so that we can refine and continuously improve the Mobile App. The information we collect for this purpose does not enable us to directly identify you.</li>
                    <li>•	Each Mobile App also sends us the device's unique device identifier, a sequence of numbers or characters that are unique to your mobile device.</li>
                    <li>•	When you use the Mobile App, you can choose to allow access to your current location—provided by your mobile device using GPS or similar technologies—in order to identify nearby hotels or airports. If you choose to allow access, this location data may be collected anonymously by our servers. You can switch off the Mobile App’s access to your location at any time through your phone’s settings menu.</li>
                    <li>•	Each Mobile App will also send us error-reporting information in the event that it crashes or hangs. This enables us to investigate the error and to improve the stability of the Mobile App for future releases. As part of these error reports, the Mobile App sends us information about the mobile device type and version, the UID, the time the error occurred, the feature being used, and the state of the application when the error occurred. We do not use this information for any purpose other than investigating and remedying the error.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you do not want our Mobile App to collect such information from you, you can remove the Mobile App from your mobile device entirely and access our services through our website instead.</p>

                <h2 id="information-security-and-protection-">Information Security and Protection</h2>

                <p>In terms of the data life cycle, we have established security measures for all stages including data collection, storage, display, processing, use, and destruction. We take different control measures according to the level of information sensitivity, including but not limited to access control, SSL encryption transmission, and high-level encryption algorithms for encrypted storage, in order to mask the sensitive information to be displayed, etc.</p>

                <h2 id="acting-as-a-processor-">Acting as a Processor</h2>
                <p>When our business clients contract with Trip.com or its affiliate companies to provide services, we work at the direction of our clients as a processor. This means that our clients dictate how we use the data they provide, how long to retain such data, and whether and how we assist with any data-related requests. If you are an end user customer of one of our business clients and have a privacy-related request or question, please contact that organization. We will assist our business clients to fulfil your request at their instruction.</p>
