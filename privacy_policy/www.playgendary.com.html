By using our Services, you agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy and consent to our processing of information as specified therein.</span></p><h2><b>1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM YOU</b></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the information that we collect about you comes directly from you when you play our Games or interact with third-party ads in our Games or with our ads in other publisher’s Games. In general, the information we collect about you relates to the type of device you are using, information that helps us identify your device, how you play our Games and may include information that you submit to us when you voluntarily contact us. We may also collect information from app store platforms and partners and other third parties such as information about your interests and in-app purchases (provided that we never receive your payment or credit card information).</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The information that we may collect about you through the Services broadly falls into the following categories:</span></p><p><strong>(a) Information that you provide voluntarily</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Certain parts of our Services may ask you to provide personal information voluntarily. For example, we will ask for certain information in order for you to submit enquiries to us, such as:</span></p><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">your name, email address or other details, necessary to process your inquiries;</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">any information you submit to our support team via email.</span></li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The personal information that you are asked to provide and the reasons why you are asked to provide it, we will try to explain to you at the point we ask you to provide your personal information.</span></p><p><strong>(b) Information that we collect automatically</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you use our Services, we may also collect certain information automatically from you and/or your device which may be considered personal information under applicable data protection laws, such as:</span></p><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data and analytics about your use of our Services (e.g. in-game play progress, levels, games played, session length, preferred settings, which in-game adverts you may have viewed, in-game references or just game preferences, the means by which you were referred to our Services)</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your IP address and device identifiers such as your Advertising ID, Device ID numbers (for more see here <span id="vladuha" style="color: #4d9eff;">Advertising IDs and Device IDs</span>)</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your device type and the operating system that you use</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your Service communications (e.g. in-game emotion signals which you exchange with other players)</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Broad geographic location (e.g. country or city-level location) based on your IP address</span></li></ul><p><script>document.getElementById('vladuha').addEventListener('click',function(){document.getElementById("addId2").scrollIntoView()})</script><br> <i><span id="addId2" style="font-weight: 400;">Advertising ID</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> means Apple Identifier for Advertisers (“IDFA”) on Apple and Google Advertising Identity (“GAID”). These are unique identifiers for mobile device that advertisers use for personalized advertising. They are consistent across all mobile applications and thus allow cross-app tracking. On Apple, you can opt out of it by choosing “limit ad tracking” option in your privacy settings. On Google Android, you can opt out of these ads by choosing “Opt-out of personalized ads”. Advertising IDs are non-permanent, non-personal identifiers, which are uniquely associated with your device.</span></p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Device identifier / information</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> means device type, device model, device maker, device operating system and its language or other technical data like screen size or processor, or combination of this data available from a device for a developer for checking the device compatibility with a particular application.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of this information may be collected through cookies as explained further under the heading </span><strong>Cookies </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">below.</span></p><p><strong>(c) &nbsp;Information we obtain from third-party sources</strong></p><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Third-Party Social Network/s.</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Play Games Service, Apple Game Center, Facebook </span><strong>(“Third-Party Social Network/s”).</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You may choose to connect to our Services via your social media account.
