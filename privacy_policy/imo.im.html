In some cases we may request your permission before we share that information, but we reserve the right to share your information with Third Parties without prior notification or without soliciting additional permission: We discuss below situations where we may share your information without requesting your further permission:</p>
<ul>
    <li>We share certain information about you (including information which could be used to personally identify you) with the companies we engage to facilitate our Service, perform Service-related functions, and/or provide the Service on our behalf, such as Internet Service Providers and hosting service providers.

These advertising partners may use this information (and similar information collected from other websites) for purposes of delivering targeted advertisements to you when you visit non-imo related websites within their networks. This practice is commonly referred to as “interest-based advertising” or “online behavioral advertising. We may allow access to other data collected by the Site to facilitate transmittal of information that may be useful, relevant, valuable or otherwise of interest to you.
