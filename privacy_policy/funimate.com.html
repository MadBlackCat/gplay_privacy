            </p><h4>Funimate App</h4>
            Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you are hereby granted a non-exclusive, limited, non-transferable, freely revocable license to use the App for your personal, private, non commercial use, and only in accordance with the features of the App as it is marketed by AVCR.

            This Privacy Policy applies to information (including personal information) collected through the Funimate App. For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, “personal information” means information that identifies you personally, either alone or in combination with other information available to us. Personal information does not include technical, device, or usage information that cannot be used to identify you personally, nor does it include “aggregate” information, which is data we collect about the use of the Funimate App or about a group or category of services or users, from which individual identities or other personal information have been removed. This Privacy Policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate and non-personal information, and we may share such data about our users with third parties for various purposes.<br><br>

            <h4>Who is responsible for the processing of your personal data</h4>
            AVCR Bilgi Teknolojileri A.S acts as data controller for the collection and processing of your personal data. In case of in app purchases AVCR acts together with the payment service provider, each for its own responsibilities. For example: the payment service provider, and not AVCR, is responsible for the processing of your data for the financial transaction and for invoicing your in-app purchases to you.<br><br>


            <h4>The What &amp; How of Information We Collect</h4>
            We collect certain personal information that you voluntarily provide to us. For example, we collect your name, email address, user name, social network information and other information you provide us when you register, set up an account, contact us by e-mail or use our services. We may also obtain information from other companies and combine that with information we collect on the Funimate App; for example, when you link your account with Facebook, we might have access to your name.<br><br>

            User Content: We collect your personal information contained in any User Content you create, share, store or submit to the App, which may include photo, video or other image files, music works, sound recording, narration, written forum comments, information, data, text, scripts, graphics and interactive features generated, provided or otherwise made accessible by Funimate App.<br><br>

            Information about others: With your permission, Funimate may access your contact list available on your mobile device or in other social networks in order to share your User Content, or to invite your friends and contacts to connect with our Service. We may also collect information about others if you use our Service to upload, share and/or distribute User Content that contains information about others, including their name, image and online contact information.<br><br>

            Content and Metadata – User Content may be accompanied by additional Content such as a hashtag (e.g., to mark keywords), comments, or may include metadata like a geotag. This makes your User Content more searchable by others and more interactive. If you geotag your photo or tag your photo using others’ APIs then your latitude and longitude will be stored with the photo and may be searchable (e.g., through a location or map feature) if your photo is made public by you in accordance with your privacy settings.<br><br>

              <li>any legal or judicial decisions that oppose the erasure </li></ul>
