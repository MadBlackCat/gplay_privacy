								<h4>We're TapBlaze</h4>
								<p>TapBlaze is founded by three brothers from Queens, NY. Currently with offices in Los Angeles and Irvine, CA. We always had childhood dreams of teaming up together one day to build an enduring game company. Although each of us have had ups and downs in our journeys in life, we had each other and the common uplifting experience of games.</p>
