	<h3>Information we collect</h3>
	When you install the Service on your device and register with LivU, personally identifiable information about you may be collected during the download process for the Service (as requested from you during the download process) when you register with us. For registration through LivU, you are required to provide your mobile phone number or your email address, city location, gender, name, depending on the device(s) you are using on the Service. You may also provide personally identifiable information, but that is optional. When you log in using your Facebook account, we may collect additional information you make available to us (see “Your User Profile”) below. 

	<br><br>In addition, when you install the Service on your device and register with LivU, you may will be asked to allow us access to your address book. If you consent, we will have access to contact information in your address book on the devices you use for the Service (names, numbers, emails, and Facebook ID, but not notes or other personal information in your address book) and we will store it on our servers and use it to help you use the Service, for example, by synchronizing your LivU contacts between different devices you may want to use with the Service. If you do not want LivU to store this information, you may opt-out through your account settings in the LivU application at any time. However we may not be able to offer some of the features that require this information. 

	<br><br>LivU may also collect and gather non-personally identifiable information, such as certain profile information including country of residence and preferences. In addition, LivU may collect and store information about your and others’ usage of and interaction with the Service and our websites, including matches, numbers of matches made by members, match durations, text messages, usage by geographies, device and connection information, IP address, device capability, bandwidth, statistics on page views, network type and traffic to and from our websites. 

	<br><br>LivU allows you to share text messages, photos, screenshots, videos and other communications in the LivU application with other users, and if you choose to do so your text messages, photos, screenshots, videos and other communications will be stored on our servers. In addition, if you choose to share these items with other LivU users, we may not be able to remove them from our servers or make them unavailable to anyone you have shared them with. Sending and sharing text messages, photos, screenshots, videos or other communications in the LivU application is your decision. By choosing to share that information, you should understand that you may no longer be able to control how that information is used and that it may become publicly available (depending in part on your actions or the actions of others with whom you have shared the information). LivU is not responsible for any use or misuse of information you share.

However, we may store other information about your purchases made on the Service, which may include the merchant’s name, the date, time and amount of the transaction and other behavioral information. 

	<br><br>We also collect error-reporting information if the Service crashes or hangs up so that we can investigate the error and improve the stability of the Service for future releases.
