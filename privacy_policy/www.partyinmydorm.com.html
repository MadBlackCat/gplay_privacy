        <p>When you use our Services, we may collect certain information automatically from your device. This information may be considered personal information under applicable data protection laws.</p>
        <p>Specifically, the information we collect automatically may include information like your IP address, device type, unique device identification numbers, browser-type, broad geographic location (e.g. country or city-level location) and other technical information.  We may also collect information about how your device has interacted with our Services, including the games played and the pages of our Website accessed.</p>
        <p>Collecting this information enables us to better understand the visitors who come to our Website, where they come from, and what content on our Website is of interest to them.  We use this information for our internal analytics purposes and to improve the quality and relevance of our Website to our visitors.</p>
        <p>Some of this information may be collected using cookies and similar tracking technology, as explained further under the heading “Cookies and similar tracking technology” below.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><i>Information that we obtain from third party sources</i></p>
        <p>From time to time, we may receive personal information about you from third party sources, but only where we have checked that these third parties either have your consent or are otherwise legally permitted or required to disclose your personal information to us.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Who does A Thinking Ape share my personal information with?</h2>
<p>We may disclose your personal information to the following categories of recipients:</p>
<ul>
    <li><p>to <b>third party services providers and partners</b> who provide data processing services to us (for example, to support the delivery of, provide functionality on, or help to enhance the security of our Website), or who otherwise process personal information for purposes that are described in this Privacy Notice or notified to you when we collect your personal information.</p></li>
    <li><p>to any <b>competent law enforcement body, regulatory, government agency, court or other third party</b> where we believe disclosure is necessary (i) as a matter of applicable law or regulation, (ii) to exercise, establish or defend our legal rights, or (iii) to protect your vital interests or those of any other person;</p></li>
    <li><p>to a <b>potential or actual buyer</b> (and its agents and advisers) in connection with any proposed or actual purchase, merger or acquisition of any part of our business, provided that we inform the buyer it must use your personal information only for the purposes disclosed in this Privacy Notice;</p></li>
    <li><p>to any <b>other person with your consent</b> to the disclosure.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Legal basis for processing personal information </h2>
<p>Our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.</p>
<p>However, we will normally collect personal information from you only (i) where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you, (ii) where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your rights, or (iii) where we have your consent to do so.</p>
<p>If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contact with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information).</p>
<p>We will process your information for the purposes of operating our Website, Games and other Services and communicating with you as necessary for those purposes and in our legitimate commercial interests, for instance, when responding to your queries, undertaking marketing activities, improving our Games, Website and other Services or for the purposes of detecting or preventing illegal activities.</p>
<p>If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us in-game or at:<br> <img src="/images/support.png" height="20em"></p>
<h2>Cookies and similar tracking technology</h2>
<p>We use cookies and similar tracking technology (collectively, “<b>Cookies</b>”) to collect and use personal information about you including to serve interest-based advertising.</p>
<h2>How does A Thinking Ape keep my personal information secure?</h2>
<p>We use appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to protect the personal information that we collect and process about you.  The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal information.</p>
<h2>International data transfers</h2>
<p>Your personal information may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are resident.  These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country.</p>
<p>Specifically, our servers are located in Canada and the USA, and our third party service providers and partners operate around the world.  This means that when we collect your personal information we may process it in any of these countries.</p>
<h2>Data retention</h2>
<p>We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).</p>
<p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
<h2>Your data protection rights</h2>
<p>You have the following data protection rights:</p>
<ul>
    <li><p>If you wish to <b>access, correct, update or request deletion</b> of your personal information, you can do so at any time by contacting us in-game or at:<br> <img src="/images/support.png" height="20em"></p></li>
    <li><p>In addition, you can <b>object to processing</b> of your personal information, ask us to <b>restrict processing</b> of your personal information or <b>request portability</b> of your personal information. Again, you can exercise these rights by contacting us in-game or at:<br> <img src="/images/support.png" height="20em"></p></li>
    <li><p>You have the right to <b>opt-out of marketing communications</b> we send you at any time.

To opt-out of other forms of marketing (such as postal marketing or telemarketing), then please contact us in-game or at:<br> <img src="/images/support.png" height="20em"></p></li>
    <li><p>Similarly, if we have collected and process your personal information with your consent, then you can <b>withdraw your consent</b> at any time.  Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p></li>
    <li><p>You have the <b>right to complain to a data protection authority</b> about our collection and use of your personal information.  For more information, please contact your local data protection authority.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>
