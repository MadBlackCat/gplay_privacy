In this regard, the delivery of the Premium Game Resource has occurred when you first have taken possession of the RAINBOW HORSE Points Cards or any other Premium Game Resource (i.e. when this is first delivered to your Account) upon your payment of the Admission Fee, as we would grant you permission to play such Premium Game Resource from, and accordingly the Restricted Game Life (as defined below) commences from, your payment of the Admission Fee (subject to processing time).

You shall not be entitled to any concession in respect of this payment term. If any payment is disputed or charged back, the associated Account(s) or access through the associated Account(s) may be suspended, terminated,&nbsp;or&nbsp;other actions in our sole discretion,&nbsp;if any fraudulent activity is detected.&nbsp;
		<br>
		(e) Security and Anti - Fraud.&nbsp;For security and anti-fraud purpose, we may require any User, whether prior to or after payment of the Admission Fee, to provide personal information such as name, address, phone number, social security number, and copy of picture ID.
