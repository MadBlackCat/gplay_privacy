<br>
</span></b>This Privacy Policy
demonstrates which personal information a user may share when running and using
TESTFONI ("TESTFONI" "We") and POZİTİM ("Company") and TESTFONI applications. Furthermore, this text also
explains how the Company has received, collected and used this data. The user
shall adhere to and respect the fundamental legal right of the user to protect
and confidentiality of the data as a reference to all data collected or
received.&nbsp;<span><br>
<br>
This Privacy Policy; explains the nature and
extent of the purpose of collecting, processing and using data. The fields
which are used so as to run our services shall be separate and autonomous from
systems, platforms, and devices (for instance, desktop computers or portable
devices).&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The term "User" shall mean all
customers/clients and visitors of our online offers and Services. The
expressions used here, for instance "User", is a non-gender
term.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
TESTFONI pays significantly great importance to
the security and protection of our users and the personal information of the
people with whom they communicate. This Privacy Policy describes how to
collect, use, share and process personal information by TESTFONI. Initial
capitalized terms not defined under this Privacy Policy are defined in Terms of
Service of TESTFONI.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
By consenting and agreeing to TESTFONI Privacy Policy and / or by way of using
its Services, you agree to the collection, use, sharing and processing of
personal information defined herein. When you give us the personal information
of a third party/another person, you are confirming that this person knows that
their information is provided/given by you and that their information is used
in line and accordance with our Privacy Policy. You can stop using this
information to prevent any further use of information you share with the
channel of the Services.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Web beacons; Web beacons (also known as Pixel
Tags) are little code strings which serve as a graphical picture on a web page
so as to transmit information such as the IP address of the computer which
downloads the page. The Users can register and log in to existing registrations
(hereafter referred to as "third-party authentication") using the
authentication services of Third Party Providers. Especially authentication
service providers of Facebook, Google or Twitter are available&nbsp;<br>
<br>
For the identification authentication through a
Third Party Provider, users must be registered with the respective Third Party
Provider and must enter the required login information into the web formula or
must have previously been signed in to the Third Party Provider.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Within the context of a registration, a user ID
is presented along with the information which the user with the user ID logs in
to. We only receive more data if the user who is using the authentication by a
Third-Party Provider depends on the confidentiality/privacy chosen by the user
to be released in the authentication context and by the user.<br>
<br>
The data in question may vary based on the provider and the user's selection.
Normally these are the email address and username. In the case of Facebook,
there is also Open to Public Profile Information, which can be seen by
everyone. This includes name, profile and cover image, sex, networks (school or
workplace), username (Facebook URL), and user ID number (Facebook ID).&nbsp;<br>
<br>
We may also use the data anonymously for
statistical purposes. For example, if we have access to the user's Facebook
chronicle, message or likes, we can evaluate how often a post is shared or
liked, to help improve our content, such as our services and quizzes and personality
tests. These evaluations are for us only, without the need to transfer these
data to third parties.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
For more information on approval process,

<br>
Users have an option to conclude the service use at any time under the Facebook
applications:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=applications" target="" rel="">https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=applications</a>.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
When you visit our Services page with social
plug-ins, your browser shall directly contact the Facebook servers. Facebook
shall directly transfer your plug-in content to your browser and embed this
plugin in the Service, thus allowing you to get information regarding what
Facebook accessed on the relevant page of our Service. For this reason, there
is no impact on the data collected by the plug-in, and we shall inform you
based on our information&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The Attachments provide information which you have accessed on the relevant
page of our Service. If you enter Facebook, your visit can be assigned to your
Facebook account. If you are interacting with attachments, for example by
clicking "Like" or entering a description, the relevant information
is passed directly from your browser to Facebook and stored by it. Even if
Facebook was not entered to, attachments are likely to forward your IP address
to Facebook.&nbsp;<br>
<br>

information on the purpose and scope of Facebook's data collection and the
setting options for protecting your rights and privacy in this area,:&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/regarding/privacy/" target="" rel="">https://www.facebook.com/regarding/privacy/</a>.&nbsp;<span><br>

If you would like to object to Facebook using
your data for marketing purposes, please use the Facebook opt-out settings
provided in your user profile:&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=ads" target="" rel="">https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=ads</a>&nbsp;or opt -<a href="http://www.regardingads.info/choices" target="" rel="">www.regardingads.info/choices</a>&nbsp;web&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com/" target="" rel="">Http://www.youronlinechoices.com</a>&nbsp;for users or EU users.

<br>
"Facebook Pixel", "App Analytics" functions are used under
our services provided by Facebook social networks, and the Audience Network's
advertisement content (hereafter referred to as "Facebook Re / Marketing
Functions"). We use Facebook Marketing Functions because we want to show
Facebook Advertisements only to users who are interested in our Service.
Facebook Re / Marketing Functions allows you to determine if our Advertisements
are effective and satisfying for users, as they can understand the actions of
users after being directed to our Service by clicking on a Facebook Advertisement.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
When you visit our service or other websites
that are members of the Facebook Follow-on Network, and you display Ads
containing or using Facebook Re / Marketing Functions, your browser shall
contact the Facebook servers directly. Facebook transfers the content of the
Facebook Re / Marketing Functions directly to the browser, which retrieves the
information regarding your device and allows you to store your device as a
Cookie (or similar functionality, especially for App Analytics functions). The
cookie also allows Facebook to store user-relevant information on your device
and to create user profiles for the purposes explained above.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The data which was collected by Facebook is
anonymous to us, so there is no information that can be personally identified
regarding yourself. However, Facebook data can link to your user profile on
your network. Facebook operates your privacy in accordance with your privacy
policy; Thus, for this reason, you can learn more regarding Facebook
Remarketing Functions and Facebook Ads in general:&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/policy.php" target="" rel="">https://www.facebook.com/policy.php</a>&nbsp;<span><br>

when using desktop or mobile devices separately from platforms and
