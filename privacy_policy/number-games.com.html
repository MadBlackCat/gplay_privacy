		<p><strong>PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>
<p><em>Last updated: 12th of May, 2019</em><br> &nbsp;<br> This Privacy Policy explains who we are, how we collect, share and use personal information about you, and how you can exercise your privacy rights.</p>
<p>We are&nbsp;2048 game, a develop team and a publisher of games and mobile game applications that are made available via app stores including the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. This Privacy Policy applies to personal information that we collect through our games, mobile applications and other products (“Games”), and websites we control, including&nbsp;https://www.number-games.com/&nbsp;(“Website”) (together “Services”). By using our Services, you agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy and consent to our processing of information as specified therein.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM YOU</li>
</ol>
<p>Most of the information that we collect about you comes directly from you when you play our Games or interact with third-party ads in our Games or with our ads in other publisher’s Games. In general, the information we collect about you relates to the type of device you are using, information that helps us identify your device, how you play our Games and may include information that you submit to us when you voluntarily contact us. We may also collect information from app store platforms and partners and other third parties such as information about your interests and in-app purchases (provided that we never receive your payment or credit card information).</p>
<p>The information that we may collect about you through the Services broadly falls into the following categories:</p>
<p><strong>(a) Information that you provide voluntarily</strong></p>
<p>Certain parts of our Services may ask you to provide personal information voluntarily. For example, we will ask for certain information in order for you to submit enquiries to us, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>your name, email address or other details, necessary to process your inquiries;</li>
<li>any information you submit to our support team via email.</li>
</ul>
<p>The personal information that you are asked to provide and the reasons why you are asked to provide it, we will try to explain to you at the point we ask you to provide your personal information.</p>
<p><strong>(b) Information that we collect automatically</strong></p>
<p>When you use our Services, we may also collect certain information automatically from you and/or your device which may be considered personal information under applicable data protection laws, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data and analytics about your use of our Services (e.g. in-game play progress, levels, games played, session length, preferred settings, which in-game adverts you may have viewed, in-game references or just game preferences, the means by which you were referred to our Services)</li>
<li>Your IP address and device identifiers such as your Advertising ID, Device ID numbers (for more see here “Advertising IDs and Device IDs”)</li>
<li>Your device type and the operating system that you use</li>
<li>Your Service communications (e.g. in-game emotion signals which you exchange with other players)</li>
<li>Broad geographic location (e.g. country or city-level location) based on your IP address</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Advertising ID</em>&nbsp;means Apple Identifier for Advertisers (“IDFA”) on Apple and Google Advertising Identity (“GAID”). These are unique identifiers for mobile device that advertisers use for interest-based advertising. They are consistent across all mobile applications and thus allow cross-app tracking. On Apple, you can opt out of it by choosing “limit ad tracking” option in your privacy settings. On Google Android, you can opt out of these ads by choosing “Opt-out of interest-based ads”. Advertising IDs are non-permanent, non-personal identifiers, which are uniquely associated with your device.</p>
<p><em>Device identifier / information</em>&nbsp;means device type, device model, device maker, device operating system and its language or other technical data like screen size or processor, or combination of this data available from a device for a developer for checking the device compatibility with a particular application.</p>
<p>Some of this information may be collected through cookies as explained further under the heading&nbsp;<strong>Cookies&nbsp;</strong>below.</p>
<p><strong>(c) &nbsp;Information we obtain from third-party sources</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Third-Party Social Networks.</strong>Google Play Games Service, Apple Game Center, Facebook&nbsp;<strong>(“Third-Party Social Networks”).</strong>&nbsp;You may choose to connect to our Services via your social media account. Exactly what information we receive from your social media will depend on your social media privacy settings, but it would typically include your basic public profile information such as your username, gender, your friends playing the same Game. (See below also “Third-Party Networks”).</li>
<li>Third party service providers. We may receive personal information about you from third-party sources. We may get your personal information for example when you installed our Game and prior to installing you have clicked an advertisement for the same Game.</li>
<li>Advertising partners. From time to time, we may also receive personal information about you from other third-party sources. For example, if you clicked on an advertisement to direct you to one of our Services (such as an advert of one of our Games in other publisher’s game), we will be provided with information from which ad network and advertising campaign the install originated from (See below also “Advertising”).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(d) No special categories of information</strong></p>
<p>We do not request or intend to collect any “special categories of information” such as any information on health, race, religion, political opinions or philosophical beliefs, sexual preferences or orientation. Kindly be cautious when sharing this information about yourself (or others) in our forums.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>ADVERTISING</li>
</ol>
<p>4.1. In General</p>
<p><strong>We use advertising to fund our Services and to make our games available for free.&nbsp;</strong>We offer our Games for free or at low cost and in order to do that we need to share information we collect from you with our third-party advertising partners. When you use our Games, we rely on our legitimate interest to show advertisements to you. Before sharing any information with our advertising partners for the purposes of interest-based advertising, we always ask for your consent, given when you accept this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use at loading of the Game. We allow our advertising partners to show interest-based ads to you only if you have accepted our Terms of use and this Privacy Policy and so consented to the sharing of your personal information for the purposes of interest-based advertising. Our advertising partners use different technologies for the purposes of interest-based advertising that process your personal information in different ways, so please review their data processing practices before you accept this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use at loading of the Game.</p>
<p>As a safeguard to protect your privacy, we only store personal information temporarily. Additionally, the user can deactivate interest-based advertising in the device settings as described below. We also ensure that our external service providers are committed to a high level of data protection by concluding data protection agreements. The purpose is to improve our Games and provide the player with more relevant ads. The information collected helps us to improve our websites and Games and – at the same time – keep our Games free for a wide player base. The legal basis is the legitimate interest in accordance with the European data protection requirements under Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR, which we evaluated together with our data protection officer. In addition, a data processing agreements were concluded with external ad technology providers networks in accordance with the requirements of Art. 28 GDPR.</p>
<p>4.2. In-game advertising&nbsp;(i.e. when you view ads in Our Games)</p>
<p>To enable us to show in-game ads, we may send your advertising ID and IP-address to advertisers (or ad networks) to enable them to find appropriate ads to serve to you in our games and on third-party properties. You can control and limit our use of your advertising ID in your device settings. We do not control which specific ads are shown in our games (it is controlled by ad networks), but we may blacklist certain categories of ads.</p>
<p>Advertising IDs are used by the ad networks for a number of purposes (please refer to the Privacy Notices of our advertising partners listed here) including:</p>
<ul>
<li>limit the number of times you see the same ad;</li>
<li>ensure they are dealing with humans with real devices and not ‘automated’ bots;</li>
<li>serve you with advertisements likely to be relevant to you based on your advertising ID engagement with other brands and ads, also recorded using your advertising ID and using your general geographic area. Other brands buy advertisement placement via an ad network or ad exchange to advertise their products in Our Games. The ad network or ad exchange acts as intermediary between the other game companies and Us. In order for an ad network to charge the company buying the ad, clicks from the ad and potentially installs of other developers’ applications party apps are tracked. Views, clicks, and installs from ads are measured using Advertiser ID;</li>
<li>keep track what games you have used to market you similar kind of games. IP-address is typically used by advertisers to broadly see the general geographic area you are coming from for example country, state, and sometimes at city level).</li>
</ul>
<p>4.3. View of Our ads on third-party services</p>
<p>We also advertise Games in other apps by asking ad networks to serve them to audiences that will be interested in them (determined using Advertising IDs).</p>
<p>The Advertising IDs are used by the ad networks for a number of purposes (please refer to the Privacy Notices of our advertising partners listed “Third Parties”) including:</p>
<ul>
<li>measuring ad effectiveness (looking at aggregated views, clicks and installs they generate through their advertising in other publishers’ games);</li>
<li>informing players, that have not been playing for a while, about new content in the Game. We give a list of these users in the form of Advertising IDs to an ad network. Ad network then shows these users ads about the new content.</li>
<li>not showing ads on a game which a player is already playing. We can send a list of active players in the form of Advertising IDs to an ad network. Ad network then excludes these players from seeing the ad.</li>
<li>marketing games to a group of potential players.</li>
</ul>
<p>4.4. WHO CAN SHOW INTEREST-BASED ADS TO YOU?</p>
<p>Please see the following list of advertising providers that are allowed to show interest-based advertising and review their data processing practices, including the technologies they use for the purposes of interest-based advertising.</p>

</ul>
<p>4.5. HOW CAN YOU TURN OFF INTEREST-BASED ADS?</p>
<p>You have an option to withdraw your consent to sharing your personal information for the purposes of interest-based advertising at all times. You can withdraw your consent by checking the privacy settings of your Android or iOS device and selecting “limit ad tracking” (Apple iOS) or “opt-out of interest based ads” (Android).</p>
<p><strong>iOS</strong></p>
<p>Open the “Settings” application of iOS and select the “Privacy” menu item and then the “Advertising” sub-item. If you activate the “Limit ad tracking” option, we can only take limited measures such as identifying unique users or combating fraud. In the same menu you can always delete the IDFA (“Reset Ad-ID”), then a new ID is created which is not merged with the data collected earlier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Android</strong></p>
<p>Open the “Settings” application and select the “Google” menu item. Depending on your device, this option may not be visible on the main menu but you may use the search function at the top of the Settings menu to find it. From there, select the “Ads” sub-item and activate the option “Opt out of Ads Personalisation” to prevent the creation of profiles and the display of interest-based advertising. You can delete the advertising ID in the same menu at any time (“Reset advertising ID”), then a new ID will be created which will not be merged with the previously collected data.</p>
