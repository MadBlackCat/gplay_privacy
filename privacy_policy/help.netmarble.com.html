Once a user indicates that he or she is under the age of 13, we will not collect any personal information from that user except certain limited information permitted by the law.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, we may ask for the name and online contact information of a child user’s parent in order to provide notice and obtain a parental consent.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, we may collect certain information permitted by the law to support and protect the security, integrity and operation of our Services.<br>
If a child states that his/her age is under 13, we will seek consent from the child’s parent before collecting personal information from the child; except we may collect and use certain information from the child for limited purposes without obtaining parental consent where permitted to do so by law.&nbsp;<br>

Where a parent has provided consent, a child may be able use our Services much like any other user, including some services that enable the child to publicly disclose personal information or communicate with other users of all ages. Once we have a parent’s consent, we may collect from the child the same types of personal information, and use and share that information for the same purposes, as described in this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;&nbsp;If we make any material changes in the way we process your child's personal information, we will notify parents by email or by in-game notice to obtain verifiable parental consent for the new uses of your child's personal information.<br>
Parents can review the personal information we have collected from their child and request them to be deleted.&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents can also revoke their previously provided consent to collection or use of the child’s information.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are a parent and wish to review, modify, or delete your child’s personal information, or withdraw consent, you can submit a request to our Privacy Administrator at the address, e-mail address or telephone number provided below.<br>
