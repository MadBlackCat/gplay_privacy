            <h3>What Information Do We Collect About You and Why?</h3>
            <hr />
            <p class="indent_p">We may collect information about you directly from you and from third parties, as well as automatically through your use of our Site, Applications or Services.</p>

            <h3>Information We Collect Directly From You and As You Play Our Games</h3>
            <hr />
            <p class="indent_p">Certain areas and features of the Applications require registration, such as to accumulate, purchase and redeem Loyalty Points, Virtual Items and Rewards, and to post any User Content.

            <h3>Information We Collect About You From Facebook</h3>
            <hr />
            <p class="indent_p">When you log into our mobile application through your Facebook account, you will be asked to enter your Facebook email address and password. Facebook controls the information collected from you during the log-in process; Bole Games does not control the information that Facebook collects from you. When you use any of our Applications, we will collect the following information: (i) access and collect your Facebook basic information (this includes your name, profile picture, gender, networks, user IDs, list of friends, date of birth, email address, and any other information you have set to public on your Facebook account); (ii) send you email; (iii) post to your Wall; (iv) access posts in your news feed; and (v) access your Facebook data at any time even if you are not using Facebook. Please note, if you allow Bole Games to have access to this information, then Bole Games will have access to this information even if you have chosen not to make that information public.</p>
            <p class="indent_p">For information about how Facebook may disclose your information, including any information you make public, please consult the Facebook Privacy Policy. We have no control over how Facebook uses or discloses the personal information you provide to it. We store the information that we receive from Facebook along with other information that we collect from you or receive about you.</p>

            <h3>Information We Collect Automatically; Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</h3>
            <hr />
            <p class="indent_p">We use cookies, including Flash cookies, and other tracking technologies (including technologies designed for mobile devices) to track information about your use of our Services. We automatically collect the following information about you from your use of our Services through these technologies: your browser type and operating system; web pages you view; links you click; your IP address; and the length of time you visit our Site, Applications, and/or use our Services.</p>
            <p class="indent_p">For users of our mobile application, in addition to the information listed above, we collect the following: language information, your geo-location (with your permission), unique device identifier (as permitted), and device name and model.</p>
            <p class="indent_p">We may use this information in the aggregate or we may combine it with personal information about you.</p>
            <p class="indent_p">Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our Site and Applications, while other cookies are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow us to track your activities at our Site and Applications. There are two types of cookies: session-based and persistent-based cookies.</p>
            <ul  class="indent_p">
              <li>Session Cookies. Session cookies exist only during an online session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser or turn off your computer. We use session cookies to allow our systems to uniquely identify you during a session or while you are logged into the Site. This allows us to process your online transactions and requests and verify your identity, after you have logged in, as you move through our Site.</li>
              <li>Persistent Cookies. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you have closed your browser or turned off your computer. We use persistent cookies to track aggregate and statistical information about user activity, which may be combined with other user information.</li>
              <li>Third Party Cookies. We may also engage third parties to track and analyze non-personally and personally identifiable Site data. We use the data collected by such third parties to help us administer and improve the quality of the Site and to analyze Site usage. Such third parties may combine the information that we provide about you with other information that they have collected. This Policy does not cover such third parties’ use of the data.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="indent_p">Disabling Cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Visitors to our Site who disable cookies will be able to browse the Site, but some features may not function.</p>
            <p class="indent_p"><strong>Clear GIFs, pixel tags and other technologies.</strong> Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use clear GIFs (a.k.a. web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our Site to, among other things, track the activities of Site visitors, help us manage content, and compile statistics about Site usage. We and our third party service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML e-mails to our customers, to help us track e-mail response rates, identify when our e-mails are viewed, and track whether our e-mails are forwarded.</p>

            <h3>Site Analytics</h3>
            <hr />
            <p class="indent_p">We use automated devices and applications, such as Google Analytics or Facebook Insights, to evaluate usage of our Site and, to the extent permitted, our Applications. We also may use other analytic means to evaluate our Services. We use these tools to help us improve our Services and user experiences.</p>

            <h3>How We Use Your Information</h3>

              <li>To tailor the content and information that we may send or display to you, to offer location customization, and to otherwise personalize your experiences while using the Site, Applications, or our Services.</li>
              <li>Where permitted by law, and in accordance with Facebook’s applicable terms and conditions, for marketing and promotional purposes. For example, we may use your information, such as your email address, to email you news and newsletters, special offers, and promotions, or to otherwise contact you about products or information we think may interest you. We may also use the information that we learn about you to determine where to assist us in advertising our Services on third party websites.</li>
              <li>To better understand how users access and use our Services, both on an aggregated and individualized basis, in order to improve our Services, analyze player traffic and activity, respond to user desires and preferences, and for other research and analytical purposes.</li>

            <p class="indent_p">You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your password private.

            <hr />
            <p class="indent_p">We may use third parties to assist us in advertising our Site, Applications and Services, and we participate in third-party ad networks that may display advertisements on other websites based on your visits to our Site as well as other websites. This enables us and these third parties to target advertisements by displaying ads for products and services in which you might be interested.</p>
            <p class="indent_p">Third-party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), LSOs and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. These third-party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party’s specific privacy policy, not this one. We may provide these third-party advertisers with information about your usage of our Site and our Services, as well as aggregate or non-personal information about visitors to our Site and users of our Service.</p>

            <p class="indent_p">Opting out of one or more NAI member or DAA member networks (many of which will be the same) only means that those members no longer will deliver targeted content or ads to you. It does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content or ads on our Site or other websites. You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing. Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different computer or change web browsers, your NAI or DAA opt-out may no longer be effective. Additional information is available on NAI’s and DAA’s websites accessible by the above links.</p>
