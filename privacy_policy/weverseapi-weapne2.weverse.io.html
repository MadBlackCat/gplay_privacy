        <p>
          In principle, once the personal data’s purpose of collection/use is achieved, the Company destroys the subject personal data without delay in accordance with the respective retention/use period.  The procedure, method, and time for destroying personal data are as follows:
        </p>
        <p>
          (1) Procedures for destroying personal data
        </p>
        <p>
          ① In the event that data provided by a Member when he/she signed up for membership must be retained or is permitted to be retained under an applicable law or regulation even after the purpose of collection/use is achieved, the data will be transferred to a separate database (if the data is provided in the form of a paper document, a separate filing cabinet), and destroyed after being retained for a certain period under the Company’s internal policy and other relevant regulations (see Article 4 (Retention/use period of personal data) above).
        </p>
        <p>
          ② The personal data that is moved to the separate database will not be used for purposes other than required or permitted by law.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) Methods for destroying personal data
        </p>
        <p>
          ① If stored in the form of electronic files, the personal data will be destroyed by technical means so that the records cannot be reproduced.
        </p>
        <p>
          ② If printed on paper, the personal data will be destroyed by shredding or incinerating the paper documents.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) Methods for destroying personal data of inactive accounts
        </p>
        <p>
          Pursuant to Article 12 of Weverse’s Terms of Use, if a Member does not use the Service for at least one year, the Member’s inactive account may be terminated and the Member’s personal data may be destroyed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Company will notify Members at least 30 days prior to terminating an inactive account, and the notice will contain the following information:
        </p>
        <p>
          - The fact that the Member’s personal data will be destroyed or separately stored
        </p>
        <p>
          - Date and time of destruction
        </p>
        <p>
          - The items of personal data to be destroyed
        </p>
        <p>
          Notifications may be sent through email or other similar method.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an exception, the information below may be maintained even after a year of inactivity.
        </p>
        <p>
          - Where a Member and an information and communications service provider (e.g., the Company) enters into a separate agreement regarding the period of retention of personal data.
        </p>
        <p>
          - Where the retention is required by applicable law or regulation
        </p>
        <p>- For the prevention of fraudulent activities, emails of the deleted accounts will be encrypted with one-way password that renders decryption impossible and will be kept for 3 months, during which sign-ups are restricted.</p>
        <p>- Once the 3-months period as explained above is over, the emails will be destroyed immediately.</p>

          Article 7 Technical/administrative measures for protecting personal data
        </div>

        <p>
          (1) In processing personal data, the Company may take reasonable safety measures to ensure that personal data is not lost, stolen, leaked, altered, or damaged.  The Company may use the following technical measures for such purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          ① A Member’s personal data is protected by password and encrypted information.  Even with these safety measures, there is still a high possibility that a Member’s password or personal data may be leaked to others if a Member accesses the Internet in a public area or through other means.  As such, what is most important is to thoroughly protect the personal data of the Members as much as possible.  Therefore, all Members should also be careful not to leak or provide their personal data to others, and take responsibility in managing their personal data.  The Company is not responsible for problems that may arise from the Member’s own negligence or the inherent dangers of using the internet.
        </p>
        <p>
          ② Fundamentally, the Members’ personal data is protected by password and encrypted information. Files and transferred data are encrypted and important data is protected by separate security features.
        </p>
        <p>
          ③ The Company uses anti-virus software to prevent damages that arise from computer viruses and regularly updates the software.
        </p>
        <p>
          ④ To prevent leakage or damage of Members’ personal data from hackings, computer viruses, and other sources of intrusion, the Company maintains a 24-hour intrusion detection and intrusion prevention system that monitors possible threats from outside sources.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) The Company recognizes the importance of protecting personal data, so we limit the number of employees who process personal data to only those that are necessary.  The Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) regularly educates/trains these employees to ensure the protection of the Members’ personal data.  Also, the Company regularly reviews the relevant employees’ compliance with the provisions of this Privacy Policy, and where a violation is found, the Company orders the employees to correct/improve the violation and take any other necessary measures.
