To make it extra clear, we’ve added links to this Privacy Policy on all applicable services.</p><p>Some services may require their own unique privacy policy. If a particular service has its own privacy policy, then that policy -- not this Privacy Policy -- applies.</p></section><section id="information-we-collect"><h3>3. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3><p>It goes without saying, we can’t help you develop meaningful connections without some information about you, such as basic profile details and the types of people you’d like to meet. We also collect information generated as you use our services, for example access logs, as well as information from third parties, like when you access our services through a social media account. If you want additional info, we go into more detail below.</p><h4><em>Information you give us</em></h4><p>You choose to give us certain information when using our services. This includes:</p><ul><li>When you create an account, you provide us with at least your login credentials, as well as some basic details necessary for the service to work, such as your gender and date of birth.</li><li>When you complete your profile, you can share with us additional information, such as details on your personality, lifestyle, interests and other details about you, as well as content such as photos and videos. To add certain content, like pictures or videos, you may allow us to access your camera or photo album. Some of the information you choose to provide us may be considered “special” or “sensitive” in certain jurisdictions, for example your racial or ethnic origins, sexual orientation and religious beliefs. By choosing to provide this information, you consent to our processing of that information.</li><li>When you subscribe to a paid service or make a purchase directly from us (rather than through a platform such as iOS or Android), you provide us or our payment service provider with information, such as your debit or credit card number or other financial information.</li><li>When you participate in surveys or focus groups, you give us your insights into our products and services, responses to our questions and testimonials.</li><li>When you choose to participate in our promotions, events or contests, we collect the information that you use to register or enter.</li><li>If you contact our customer care team, we collect the information you give us during the interaction. Sometimes, we monitor or record these interactions for training purposes and to ensure a high quality of service.</li><li>If you ask us to communicate with or otherwise process information of other people (for example, if you ask us to send an email on your behalf to one of your friends), we collect the information about others that you give us in order to complete your request.</li><li>Of course, we also process your chats with other users as well as the content you publish, as part of the operation of the services.</li></ul><h4><em>Information we receive from others</em></h4><p>In addition to the information you provide us directly, we receive information about you from others, including:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Other Users</strong><br><span>Other users may provide information about you as they use our services. For instance, we may collect information about you from other users if they contact us about you.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Social Media</strong><br><span>You may be able to use your social media login (such as Facebook Login) to create and log into your Tinder account. This saves you from having to remember yet another user name and password and allows you to share some information from your social media account with us.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Other Partners</strong><br><span>We may receive info about you from our partners, for instance where Tinder ads are published on a partner’s websites and platforms (in which case they may pass along details on a campaign’s success).</span></p></li></ul><h4><em>Information collected when you use our services</em></h4><p>When you use our services, we collect information about which features you’ve used, how you’ve used them and the devices you use to access our services. See below for more details:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Usage Information</strong><br><span>We collect information about your activity on our services, for instance how you use them (e.g., date and time you logged in, features you’ve been using, searches, clicks and pages which have been shown to you, referring webpage address, advertising that you click on) and how you interact with other users (e.g., users you connect and interact with, time and date of your exchanges, number of messages you send and receive).</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Device information</strong><br><span>We collect information from and about the device(s) you use to access our services, including:</span></p><ul><li>hardware and software information such as IP address, device ID and type, device-specific and apps settings and characteristics, app crashes, advertising IDs (such as Google’s AAID and Apple's IDFA, both of which are randomly generated numbers that you can reset by going into your device’ settings), browser type, version and language, operating system, time zones, identifiers associated with cookies or other technologies that may uniquely identify your device or browser (e.g., IMEI/UDID and MAC address);</li><li>information on your wireless and mobile network connection, like your service provider and signal strength;</li><li>information on device sensors such as accelerometers, gyroscopes and compasses.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Other information with your consent</strong><br><span>If you give us permission, we can collect your precise geolocation (latitude and longitude) through various means, depending on the service and device you’re using, including GPS, Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connections. The collection of your geolocation may occur in the background even when you aren’t using the services if the permission you gave us expressly permits such collection. If you decline permission for us to collect your geolocation, we will not collect it.</span><br><span>Similarly, if you consent, we may collect your photos and videos (for instance, if you want to publish a photo, video or streaming on the services).</span></p></li></ul></section><section id="cookie-and-similar-tech"><h3>4. COOKIES AND OTHER SIMILAR DATA COLLECTION TECHNOLOGIES</h3><p>We use and may allow others to use cookies and similar technologies (e.g., web beacons, pixels) to recognize you and/or your device(s). You may read our <a href="/cookie-policy">Cookie Policy</a> for more information on why we use them (such as authenticating you, remembering your preferences and settings, analyzing site traffic and trends, delivering and measuring the effectiveness of advertising campaigns, allowing you to use social features) and how you can better control their use, through your browser settings and other tools.</p><p>Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome) have a “Do Not Track” (“<strong>DNT</strong>”) feature that tells a website that a user does not want to have his or her online activity tracked. If a website that responds to a DNT signal receives a DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting certain information about the browser’s user. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform. For this reason, many businesses, including Tinder, do not currently respond to DNT signals.</p></section><section id="how-we-use-info"><h3>5. HOW WE USE INFORMATION</h3><p>The main reason we use your information is to deliver and improve our services.

HOW WE SHARE INFORMATION</h3><p>Since our goal is to help you make meaningful connections, the main sharing of users’ information is, of course, with other users. We also share some users’ information with service providers and partners who assist us in operating the services, with other Match Group companies and, in some cases, legal authorities. Read on for more details about how your information is shared with others.</p><ul><li><h4>With other users</h4><p>You share information with other users when you voluntarily disclose information on the service (including your public profile). Please be careful with your information and make sure that the content you share is stuff that you’re comfortable being publically viewable since neither you nor we can control what others do with your information once you share it.</p><p>If you choose to limit the audience for all or part of your profile or for certain content or information about you, then it will be visible according to your settings.</p></li><li><h4>With our service providers and partners</h4><p>We use third parties to help us operate and improve our services.
