<h4>Cookies</h4>

You can disable cookies at any time, although by doing so, you may not be able to access or use all of the features of the Service.</p>
<p>We may feature advertisements served by third parties that deliver cookies to your computer/device so the Content you access and advertisements you see can be tracked.

<h4>Third Party Services</h4>
<p>Our services may contain third party tracking tools from our service providers, examples of which include tracking tools from Amazon Mobile Analytics, Google Analytics, Unity Analytics and Appsflyer. Such third parties may use cookies and other software tools in our services to enable them to collect and analyze user information on our behalf.

  <h2>11. Children’s Privacy</h2>
</div>
<p>We recognize the need to provide further privacy protections with respect to personal information we may collect from children on our Sites and Games. Some of the features on our Sites and Games are age-gated so that they are not available for use by children, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children in connection with those features.</p>
<p>When we intend to collect personal information from children, we take additional steps to protect children’s privacy, including:
</p><ul><li>Notifying parents about our information practices with regard to children, including the types of personal information we may collect from children, the uses to which we may put that information, and whether and with whom we may share that information</li>
<li>In accordance with applicable law, obtaining consent from parents for the collection of personal information from their children, or for sending information about our products and services directly to their children</li>

  <h2>12. California Residents: Your California Privacy Rights</h2>
</div>
<p>Under the laws of the State of California (US), California Residents who have an established business relationship with us may choose to opt out of our disclosure of personal information about them to third parties for direct marketing purposes. As detailed above, our policy is not to disclose personal information collected online to a third party for direct marketing purposes without your approval. If you choose to opt-out at any time after granting approval, email <a href="mailto:privacyofficer@pikpok.com">privacyofficer@pikpok.com</a>.</p>
<p>In September 2013, California enacted amendments to the California Online Privacy Protection Act (California Business &amp; Professions Code §§22575-22579) which require operators of websites to disclose how they respond to “do not track” (DNT) signals from browsers used by consumers or other mechanisms that provide consumers a choice regarding the collection of personally identifiable information about the consumer’s online activities over time and across different websites or online services. While some newer browsers have incorporated “Do Not Track” features which, when turned on, send a signal or preference to the web sites you visit indicating that you do not wish your online activity to be tracked, a DNT protocol that can be implemented across multiple devices and sites has not yet been widely adopted. Currently, our computer system does not support, and cannot act on DNT signal headers that we may receive; accordingly, the choices that we provide you concerning out collection and use of personally identifiable information will continue to operate as described in this policy.</p>
