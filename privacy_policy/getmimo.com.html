					<h2>5. Updating or deleting Information</h2>

					<h3>5.1</h3>
					<p>We store your Data as long as you are a registered user of the Services.

					<h3>6.2</h3>
					<p>You can revoke the consent for future data processing at any time. However, this does not affect the lawfulness of Data processing based on the consent before the revocation. Should the processing of Data be lawful due to another reason stated in 4.2, we may continue to process your Data on these grounds.</p>

					<h3>6.3</h3>
					<p>You have the right to obtain (i) confirmation as to whether or not your Data is being processed by us and, if so, (ii) more specific information on the Data.
