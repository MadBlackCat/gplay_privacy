        <h3 id="we-do-not-identify-you">We do not Identify You</h3><hr>

        <p>At Wuma, we stand behind our commitment to user privacy and security. When you
            access our websites and use our best-in-class VPN products, you’ll share some information with us,
            which we use to provide and improve our products, send notifications and updates, troubleshoot, and
            to support our free product through advertising. Our goal is to be upfront about what we collect,
            how we use it, and whom we share it with, and that’s why we’ve written this Privacy Policy. This
            Privacy Policy also tells you about your rights and choices with respect to your information, and
            how you can contact us if you have any questions or concerns. Below is a snapshot of some of our
            important privacy practices, but please read the full Policy for more detail. If you have any
            questions about anything in this Policy.</p>

        <hr class="terms-separator"><h3 id="privacy-overview">
        Privacy overview</h3><hr>
        <ul>
            <li>Our VPN product will never store or log your IP address beyond the duration of your VPN session,
                and we always delete your IP address after you disconnect from the VPN.
            </li>
            <li>We do not keep logs of your online activities and never associate any domains, or applications
                that you access while the Wuma VPN is connected with you, your device.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>While we always de-identify your IP address while connected to the VPN, remember that no VPN provider
            can control what other apps collect from your device or what cookies other websites or third parties
            place in your browser. </p>

        <hr class="terms-separator"><h3 id="security-overview">Security Overview</h3><hr>

        <p>When the Wuma VPN is connected, we encrypt all of the traffic between your device and our
            servers, using TLS 1.2 with perfect forward secrecy (ECDHE), 128-bit/256-bit AES GCM data encryption
            technology. ChaCha20 Poly1305, among other currently secure algorithms, is also available and
            configurable for performance.</p>

        <p>Your web traffic on unsecured networks such as public Wi-Fi at cafés, airports, etc. is always
            securely encrypted when the Wuma VPN is connected.</p>

        <hr class="terms-separator"><h3 id="what-does-this-privacy-policy-cover">What does this Privacy Policy cover?</h3><hr>

        <p>This Privacy Policy covers the free and paid versions of Wuma, including the mobile and
            desktop applications, as well as the Wuma websites. (collectively, the “Services”). The
            terms “Wuma,” “we,” “us,” and “our” include Wuma, Inc. and our
            affiliates and subsidiaries. By using the Services, you agree to the terms and conditions of this
            Privacy Policy. Beyond the Privacy Policy, your use of the Services is also subject to our <a href="https://github.com/mumavpn/Wuma/blob/master/FAQ-English.md">Terms of Service</a>.</p>

        <p>Separate from our consumer applications, Wuma licenses its technology to third party partners
            for integration with their applications. This Privacy Policy may also apply to our partner
            applications. However, this Privacy Policy does not apply to the extent that we only process
            Personal Information on behalf of our partners as part of third party partner products. To learn
            more about the processing of your Personal Information in that context, please refer to the relevant
            partner’s privacy policy.</p>


        <hr class="terms-separator"><h3 id="what-personal-information-do-we-collect">What Personal
        Information do we collect?</h3><hr>

        <p>For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, “Personal Information” means any information relating to an
            identified or identifiable individual. We obtain Personal Information relating to you from various
            sources described below.</p>

        <p>Where applicable, we indicate whether and why you must provide us with your Personal Information, as
            well as the consequences of failing to do so. If you do not provide Personal Information when
            requested, you may not be able to benefit from some features of our Services if that information is
            necessary to provide you with that feature of our Services.</p>

        <p>There are two basic categories of Personal Information we collect:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Personal Information you choose to give us</li>
            <li>Personal Information we automatically collect when you use our Services</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can be assured that the Personal Information we may collect, including your IP address,
            username, or mobile ID, is never associated with any online activities you engage in while
            the Wuma VPN is connected. Additionally, when the Wuma VPN is connected, your IP
            address is stored in encrypted format for the duration of the session and is deleted after you
            disconnect from the VPN.</p>

        <hr class="terms-separator"><h3 id="personal-information-you-choose-to-give-us">Personal Information
        You Choose to Give Us</h3><hr>

        <p>When you interact with our Services,we never require you to register or otherwise provide
            us any account-related information to download or use our products.</p>

        <p>Additionally, if you make a payment using a credit or debit card through the Services, your Personal
            Information will be collected by a third-party payment provider and not by us. If you make a payment
            via PayPal, or in the Google Play Store, payments are processed by those third
            parties, and will be subject to the third party’s privacy policy, rather than this Privacy
            Policy.</p>

        <p>It probably goes without saying, but we’ll say it anyway: If you contact us directly, we may receive
            additional Personal Information about you. For example, when you contact customer support, we
            receive the contents of messages or attachments that you send to us, and other information you
            choose to provide.</p>


        <hr class="terms-separator"><h3 id="personal-information-we-collect-automatically-when-you-use-the-services">Personal
        Information We Collect Automatically When You Use the Services</h3><hr>

        <p>When you download the Wuma app, connect to the Wuma VPN, or visit our websites,
            we and our third party service providers(e.g., Google Analytics, Maxmind，admob) collect information about you or your device automatically.
            Here’s a fuller explanation of the types of Personal Information collected when you use our
            Services:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><u>When you launch the Wuma app, before you connect to the VPN</u>, we and our service
                providers collect device-specific information, such as the unique mobile ID, hardware model,
                operating system version, language, and network information. We may also use, but never log or
                store, your IP address to derive your approximate (city-level) location. We use this information
                to provide and improve the Services, troubleshoot, and perform analytics on our services. Our
                service providers may collect IP addresses for marketing attribution purposes.
            </li>
			
            <li><u>When you connect to the Wuma VPN</u>, we collect your IP address, immediately
                encrypt it and store it only for the duration of your VPN session. Your IP address is deleted
                after you disconnect from the VPN. We do not associate your IP address with your online
                activities and we do not store or log your IP address after you disconnect from the VPN.
                <ul>
					
			<li>We also use Google Analytics and analyze information about use of the Services and report on activities and trends. You can learn about Google’s practices by going to www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/</li>
					
                    <li>We do not attribute any specific website visits or app usage to any specific user.
                        <strong>We do not keep logs of your online activities and never associate any domains or
                            applications that you use with you, your device, or email.</strong> Websites visited
                        via our servers are aggregated and stored to: (1) Perform analytics on our services,
                        including measuring whether our users, in aggregate, are able to successfully access
                        certain websites or apps; (2) Troubleshoot service issues and improve service quality.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <hr class="terms-separator"><h3 id="third-party-advertising">Third Party Advertising</h3><hr>

        <p>For users that choose to use our
            products for free, we are proud to offer a free, advertising-supported version of Wuma. On
            the free version of Wuma, you may see some generic ads that our ad partners place. Wuma does not share your browsing history or any other information you choose to provide, with
            advertisers. Furthermore, when the VPN is connected, Wuma anonymizes your IP address, thus
            showing advertisers the IP address of Wuma servers instead of your IP address. We may
            share your general (city level) location. Additionally, advertisers may be able to collect certain
            information independently from you or your device when serving ads from the Wuma
            application, including your device’s advertising ID, IMEI, MAC address, and wireless carrier. Keep
            in mind that advertisers may be able to access your IP address if your device is not connected to
            the Wuma VPN. For more information regarding your device’s advertising ID and its options,
            please visit <a href="https://github.com/mumavpn/Wuma/blob/master/FAQ-English.md">Knowledgebase</a></p>



        <hr class="terms-separator"><h3 id="how-do-we-use-your-personal-information">How do we
        use your Personal Information?</h3><hr>

        <p>In short, we use your Personal Information to provide you with amazing products and services that we

                information that you request, respond to comments and questions, and otherwise provide support

            <li>For marketing purposes, such as sending marketing messages, or campaign attribution and
                optimization for user acquisition.
            </li>
            <li>For our business purposes, such as audits, security, fraud monitoring and prevention.</li>
            <li>To enforce our Terms of Service or other legal rights.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you are located in the European Economic Area, we only process your Personal Information based on
            a valid legal ground, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>When we need your Personal Information to provide our services, including for account
                registration, to respond to your inquiries, or for customer support;
            </li>
            <li>We have a legal obligation to use your Personal Information (such as to enforce our terms and
                conditions);
            </li>
            <li>When we or a third party have a legitimate interest in using your Personal Information. In
                particular, we have a legitimate interest in using your Personal Information to troubleshoot
                issues, perform product improvement, conduct business analytics, conduct and optimize user
                acquisition, serve non-personalized ads, and otherwise monitor and improve the safety, security,
                and performance of our Service. We only rely on our or a third party’s legitimate interests to
                process your Personal Information when these interests are not overridden by your rights and
                interests;
            </li>
            <li>If you otherwise consent to the processing of your Personal Information.</li>
        </ul>

        <hr class="terms-separator"><h3 id="how-do-we-share-your-personal-information">How do we share your Personal Information?</h3><hr>

        <p>We only share your Personal Information as described in this privacy policy in order to provide and
            improve the Services, facilitate a merger or sale of our business, or if required to do so by law.
            As stated above, we do not log your browsing data and we delete your IP address when you disconnect
            from the VPN. Here are some more specifics on whom we share your information with and why:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To our third party service providers who provide services such as website hosting, payment
                processing, data analysis, information technology and related infrastructure provision, customer
                service, email delivery, fraud prevention, online advertising, auditing, and other services.
            </li>
            <li>When you launch the Wuma app, we may also use your IP address, which we automatically
                delete after you disconnect from the VPN, to derive your approximate (city-level) location. When
                you are connected to the Wuma VPN, advertisers are prevented from seeing your IP
                address, however if you are using the free version of Wuma we may share this
                approximate (city-level) location. 
            
            </li><li>Again, we do not require you to provide us with any contact information in order to download or
                use our VPN product, we do not log or store your IP address after you disconnect from the VPN,
                and we do not keep logs on your online activities. Therefore, we generally do not have Personal
                Information to share with law enforcement, and generally do not have the data to provide in
                response to law enforcement requests.
                <ul>
                    <li>However, we may share what Personal Information we do have if required to do so by law
                        or in the good faith belief that such action is appropriate: (a) to enforce our
                        terms and conditions; (b) to protect our operations or those of any of our affiliates;
                        (c) to protect our rights, privacy, safety or property, and/or that of our affiliates,
                        you or others; and (d) to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages
                        that we may sustain.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
