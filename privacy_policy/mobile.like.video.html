<strong><span>Law Enforcement</span></strong>
</p>
<p>
<span>LIKE is willing to cooperate with law enforcement agencies to combat crimes.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>Due to security concerns, we are unable to accept requests for non-public user information that are served via email. Except for exigent emergency involving imminent danger to life, original document of the formal request (subpoena, search warrant, court order or other legal proceedings) and any supporting document (such as scan copy of identification card or police badge) must be served to the office address of Bigo Technology Pte. Ltd. (as indicated above) before the user information is released to the law enforcement agencies. We encourage law enforcement agencies to notarize the formal request to help us verify its authenticity. We will not release sensitive user information unless we are convinced of the authenticity of the request.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>The formal request should: (a) identify the LIKE ID or UID of requested account, (b) identify the information requested, (c) indicate the purpose of the request or indicate that the purpose is confidential; and (d) state the legal basis for the request. If the formal request is not in English, we encourage the law enforcement agencies to provide an English translation.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>LIKE will keep the existence of the request confidential if requested by the law enforcement agencies. However, LIKE may take actions against any account that violates the User Agreement, including disabling the account.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>We encourage law enforcement agencies to contact us via email (legal@bigo.tv) regarding the availability of user information before serving the formal request.</span>
</p>
<p>
<strong><span>Security Safeguards</span></strong>
</p>
<p>
<span>LIKE will use commercially reasonable security measures to protect your data. For example, under certain conditions, LIKE may use the universally accepted SSL encryption system to ensure the security of information transfer.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>Please note that despite our efforts, transfer of information on the Internet is never completely secure.</span>
</p>
<p>
<strong><span>Global Operation</span></strong>

<p>
<span>In order to provide Services to our users all over the world, we operate globally. You hereby authorize us to transfer, store, and use your data in any country and region we operate, including Singapore, the People’s Republic of China and the European Union. Please note that data processed in a foreign country may be subject to foreign laws and accessible by foreign authorities. However, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of your information.</span>

<strong><span>Third-party Data</span></strong>
</p>
<p>
<span>LIKE may contain links to a third-party website. We cannot control the behaviors of such third-party website.</span>
