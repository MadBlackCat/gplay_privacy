<h2>Mico's Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>
    The Privacy Policy("Policy")was written in English (US) and will be the agreement between You and Mico World Limited ("Mico", "We") while you are using Mico's applications ("APP"). To the extent any translated version of this Policy conflicts against the English version, this English version prevails.</p>

<p>Date of Last Revision: January 24, 2017</p>

<h2>The Summary</h2>

<p>
    If you visit here from <a href="http://www.meetsmiles.com/terms/terms.html">Terms and Conditions of Use draft by Mico</a>. You should read this privacy
    policy because it will tell you exactly how your personal data is being looked after by
    Mico and it is very important for you to know. Here are the topics that we cover:
</p>

<p> 1. What information we collect and how we collect it.</p>

<p> 2. How we use the information and who we share it with.</p>

<p> 3. How you can access and update such information.</p>

<p> 4. How we protect the information we store about you.</p>

<h2>The full legal bit</h2>

<p>
    We know that other people’s use of your personal data is a big concern for social network users, so we at Mico have
    developed this privacy policy (the "Policy") to let you know how we use personal information ('personal data' or
    'personal information').
</p>

<p>
    Our Policy applies to your use of the Mico website at www.micous.com (“Mico” or the “site” which includes APP). We suggest you read it in conjunction with our Terms and Conditions of Use (the “Terms”). When you
    access or use Mico, you agree to our Privacy Policy and you consent to our collection, storage, use and disclosure
    of your personal information as we’ve set out in this Policy.
</p>

<p>
    Mico reserves the right to change this Policy at any time and without notice, so be sure to check this Policy
    regularly to understand how we use your information.
</p>

<p>
    By installing, using, registering to or otherwise accessing the services, you agree to this privacy policy and give an explicit and informed consent to the processing of your personal data in accordance with this privacy policy. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT AND AGREE WITH OUR PRIVACY POLICY THEN YOU MUST NOT ACCESS OR USE THE SITE.
</p>

<h2>1. Mico user's information</h2>

<p>
    To join the Mico you will have to complete our online registration form, where we ask you to provide us
    with information about you such as your name, your gender, your date of birth, your location
    details. You also have the opportunity to provide other details about yourself, but these are optional. Because you
    control your user profile, these details are available to you at any time by accessing your “Profile” page, which
    gives you the chance to correct or update (other than gender) your information at any time by just
    logging in to Mico.
</p>

<h3>
    What information does Mico collect
</h3>

<p>
    Once you have created a Profile, we will automatically track certain information such as your IP, device
    locale, timezone. And we also collect infomation about WiFi access points as well as other location information
    about your longitude and latitude. That information helps us identify your physical location so that it can be
    displayed and shared with other users choosing to view "nearby" users and moments. We may from time to time allow
    our
    employees to use the product for testing and user engagement
    purposes.
</p>

<p>
    For safety and security and to ensure you have the best possible user experience, we require users to verify their
    accounts (because we want to make sure you are not a robot!) and might ask for your phone number or Facebook
    Account. Don’t worry! This
    is only to make sure you are real and breathing! We won't use your phone number for marketing purposes.
</p>

<p>
    When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information, including your web request,
    Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you
    interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. We may
    also collect similar information from emails sent to our Users which then help us track which emails are opened and
    which links are clicked by recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the
    Service.
</p>

<h3>
    How we use your information
</h3>

<p>
    In addition to some of the specific uses of information we describe in this Privacy Policy, we may use information
    that we receive to:
</p>

<p>1. help you efficiently access your information after you sign in;</p>

<p>2. remember information so you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the
    Service;</p>

<p>3. provide personalized content and information to you and others, which could include online ads or other forms of
    marketing;</p>

<p>4. provide, improve, test, and monitor the effectiveness of our Service;</p>

<p>5. develop and test new products and features;</p>

<p>6. monitor metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns;</p>

<p>7. diagnose or fix technology problems;</p>

<p>8. automatically update the APP on your device Mico or other Users may run contests, special offers or
    other events or activities ("Events") on the Service. If you do not want to participate in an Event, do not use the
    particular Metadata (i.e. hashtag or geotag) associated with that Event.</p>

<h3>
    If I put other information about me on the Mico, what does Mico do with it?
</h3>

<p>
    Mico is designed to make it easy for you to find, connect and interact with other users of Mico by posting
    information about yourself. When using the App you should assume that anything you post or submit will be publicly
    viewable and accessible, both by Users of the App and non-Users of the App. For example, to make it easier to find
    other Micors and connect with them, we have allowed you to share other users' profiles or moment on Facebook. This
    feature
    can be turned off in your settings at any time. You can also use our instant message function, which allows you
    to communicate with other users. We recommend and encourage you (and all our users) to think carefully about the
    information they disclose about themselves. We also do not
    recommend that you put email addresses, URLs, instant messaging details, phone numbers, full names or addresses,
    credit card details, national identity numbers, drivers’ licence details and other sensitive information in your
    Profile which is open to abuse and misuse.
</p>

<p>
    Please be careful about posting sensitive details about yourself on you Profile such as your religious denomination
    and health details. While you may voluntarily provide this information to us when you create your Profile, including
    your sexual preferences and ethnic background, there is no requirement to do so. Please remember that photographs or
    any video clips that you post on Mico may reveal these kinds of sensitive personal data. Where you do upload and
    choose to tell us sensitive information about yourself, you are explicitly consenting to our processing your
    information and making this public to other users.
</p>

<p>
    When you post information about yourself or use the messaging, the amount of personal information you share is at
    your own risk. If you post anything that is inconsistent with our Terms and Conditions of Use, we reserve the right
    to terminate your account.

<h2>
    3. Data storage
</h2>

<p>
    Mico is a global social application operating through servers located in a number of countries around the world, including
    the United States. If you live in a country with data protection laws, the storage of your personal data may not provide
    you with the same protections as you enjoy in your country of residence. By submitting your personal information, or
    by choosing to upgrade the services you use, or by making use of the applications available on Mico, you agree to
    the transfer of your personal information to, and storage and processing of your personal information in, any such
    countries and destinations.
</p>

<h2>
    4. Security
</h2>

<h3>
    How does Mico protect my personal information?
</h3>

<p>
    Mico has implemented reasonable and appropriate security measures to protect and prevent the loss, misuse, and
    alteration of the information under our control, including your personal information. Mico uses reasonable security
    measures to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal information such as secured servers using firewalls. Our
    technical experts at Mico work hard to ensure your secure use of our site.
</p>

<p>
    While we take reasonable precautions against possible security breaches of our website, member database and records
    no website or Internet transmission is completely secure and we cannot guarantee that unauthorised access, hacking,
    data loss, or other breaches will never occur. We urge you to take steps to keep your personal information safe
    (including your password) and to log out of your account after use.
</p>

<p>
    We cannot guarantee the security of your personal data while it is being transmitted to our site and any
    transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information we have procedures and security features in
    place to try to prevent unauthorised access.
</p>

<h3>
    How do I help keep my information secure?
</h3>

<p>
    You may not disclose your password to any third parties or share it with any third parties. If you lose your
    password or give it out, your personal information may be compromised. If that happens, please report it to Support
    via Feedback. You must change your password immediately via your “Settings” page. Mico cannot be held
    responsible for your failure to keep your password secure and failure to do so may violate our Terms and Conditions
    of Use.
</p>

<h2>
    5. Your rights
</h2>

<p>
    You can review and revise your profile information at any time. Once you register, you will be able to review and
    change much of your personal information except gender. If you want to stop using your account it will be initially
    deactivated. This means that no user will be able to search for you on App although they may still see you
    profile from direct cached links, but it will not be deleted. We save your profile information in case you later
    decide to restore your account. Many users deactivate their accounts for temporary reasons and in doing so expect us
    to maintain their information until they return to Mico. You will therefore be able to restore your account and
    your profile in its entirety within 30 days of de-activating it.
</p>

<p>
    After the expiration of 30 days, your account is permanently deleted from Mico. We delete photographs from our
    servers within 14 days from the expiration of the deactivation period while other information (such as contact
    history) is deleted by us over a longer timescale, by way of housekeeping on a periodic basis. You should only
    delete your account if you are certain you never want to restore it.
</p>

<p>
    To prevent abuse and/or misuse of Mico by a user following termination or deletion of a profile/account We shall
    retain such information as we deem in our sole discretion may be necessary to ensure that user does not open a new
    account and profile in breach of our Terms and Conditions of Use and to ensure compliance with all laws and
    regulations.
</p>
