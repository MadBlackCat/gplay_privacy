        <h4>Visiting our Website</h4>
        <p>
            As soon as you visit our website, the company we have entrusted with the website’s operation will store the public IP address of the computer you are using to visit our website. This
            includes the access date and time. The IP address is a unique numeric address, through which your computer sends and receives data via the internet. Usually, neither we nor our service
            provider will know whom the IP address belongs to, unless you provide us with any data permitting us to identify you while using our website. Also, a user can be identified if we take
            legal action (in cases of cyber-attacks on our website, for instance) and are informed of the user’s identity during the process of investigation. So as a general rule, you will not have
            to worry we will be able to draw a connection between you and your IP address.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our service provider is using the IP address to enable you to visit and use our website, and to discover and prevent attacks on our websites. Unfortunately, websites are attacked
            frequently, in order to harm the operators and users (for example blocking the access, spying on data, distributing malware like viruses or other illegal purposes). Such attacks would
            adversely affect our website’s intended use as well as the security of our website’s visitors. The IP address, along with the visit’s time, is being processed to prevent such attacks and
            potential dangers resulting from them for ourselves and for our website’s users. Via our service provider we are pursuing the justified interests of maintaining our business operations as
            well as of preventing unlawful interference affecting ourselves or our website’s visitors. The legal basis of this processing activity is article 6 paragraph 1 f) of the General Data
            Protection Regulation (GDPR). The stored IP data will be deleted by de-personalization, provided they are no longer necessary for the purpose of identifying or preventing attacks.
        </p>

        <h4>Ways of Contact</h4>
        <p>
            Whenever you contact us via one of the ways of contact provided, we will make use of the data provided by you to process your inquiry. The legal basis for this is our justified interest in
            replying to your request according to article 6 paragraph 1 f of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). If your request is serving the purpose of concluding or processing a
            contract with us, the additional basis of the processing activity is article 6 paragraph 1 b of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The data will be deleted after your request
            has been completed. In cases in which we are obligated by law to store the data for a longer period, they will be deleted after the expiry of this period.
        </p>

        <h4>Creating a Customer Account</h4>
        <p>
            You are using our service to have erotic adventures and contact other users. To use all of our offer’s functionalities, you need to create a customer account. Apart from the information
            required during the registration process, all other personal information will be provided voluntarily. You alone decide what information you would like to include in your user profile. You
            can edit or delete your data at any time. The more information you provide, the higher are the chances for other users to find you and recognize mutual interests you share with them. As
            our website is accessible for everyone via the internet, all the information provided by you will be public.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you do not provide any data permitting us to identify you (such as your mobile number), you can use our service without us knowing who you are.&nbsp;If you buy coins,&nbsp;you will have to
            provide your name and your address, but only our payment service provider will receive this data, which they will not forward to us. Accordingly, you will be able to use our service

            their intended purpose (for example searching for specific inclinations and interests, match checks to identify mutual interests and preferences).&nbsp;The legal basis of this processing
            activity is article 6 paragraph 1 b) of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
        </p>
        <p>
            During the process of creating a user account, we will be able to identify your approximate location, based on your IP address. We will use this to pre-enter this location in your user
            profile, which you can change. This is done to ensure that the members of our service will use the correct location for local searches and thereby – unless they adapt the location – will
            find other members. The legal basis of this processing activity is article 6 paragraph 1 f) of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
        </p>
        <p>
            The data will be stored until the customer account is deleted. In cases in which we are obligated by law to store the data beyond this event (to fulfill accounting obligations, for
            instance), or if we are legally entitled to store the data beyond this event (in case of a current lawsuit against the user account owner, for instance), the data will be deleted as soon
            as the obligation or the legal authorization to store the data ceases to exist.
        </p>

        <p>
            This website is using Google Analytics, a service by Google&nbsp;LLC („Google“). The use is based on article article 6 paragraph 1 subparagraph 1 letter f) of the General Data Protection
            Regulation (GDPR).
            <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=de" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=de</a>.

        <p>
            Google Analytics is making use of so-called „Cookies”, which are small text files, which are stored on your computer, and which permit an analysis of your use of the website. The
            information regarding your use of the website created by the cookie, such as

            brought together with any other data by Google. The way we use Google Analytics ensures that your IP address will be used in a de-personalized way only. According to Google’s statement
            this de-personalization will be done within the European Union or within a member state of the European Economic Area. It will only be in exceptional cases in which the complete IP address
            shall be transferred to one of Google’s servers within the USA and only be abbreviated at that point. According to Google’s statement the de-personalization will be done before the IP
            address will be stored initially on a permanent data medium. For details, please refer to Google’s privacy policy, accessible via&nbsp;<a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en</a>.

        <h4>Advertisements</h4>
        <p>
            We have advertisements displayed on other websites to win new customers. In order to primarily contact persons who have previously visited our website and therefore are likely to be
            interested in our products, we make use of advertising partners, who use so-called “retargeting functions”.

        <p>
            For this functionality, the service provider will assign a pseudonymous identification number (ID) to your browser to be able to process which advertisements have already been displayed in
            your browser and which you have accessed. This is done via cookies, which do not contain any further personal data. These cookies make it possible to place advertisements on websites using
            this service as well, based on your previous visits on our or other websites.
        </p>
        <p>
            The legal basis of this processing activity of your personal data is article 6 paragraph 1 f) of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). We are pursuing the justified interest in
            winning new customers. It is our conviction that our advertising measures will be more effective, and therefore more successful, if we have them displayed in cases in which they meet the
            assumed interests of the respective website’s user. According to market expertise advertisements are more effective and clicked more frequently, if they meet the assumed interests of the
            website’s users.
        </p>
        <p>
            Apart from the options stated above, you can also object to the respective use of your data by setting so-called “opt-out cookies” on the Digital Advertising Alliance’s website, using

            cookies from
            so-called third-party providers, or just those from the website you have visited.
            You can also install an add-on like uBlock Origin (<a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/</a>) in your browser,
            which will allow
            you to block data transfers to third parties to a great extent.
