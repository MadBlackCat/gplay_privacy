To customize your experience
We process your personal data, such as physical characteristics and food preferences, to adjust the content of the Service and make offers tailored to your personal preferences. As a result of such processing, you get access, for example, to a nutrition plan containing only vegetarian products.
To manage your account and provide you with customer support
We process your personal data to respond to your requests for technical support, Service information or to any other communication you initiate. This includes accessing your account to address technical support requests. For this purpose, we may send you, for example, notifications or emails about the performance of our Service, security, payment transactions, notices regarding our Terms and Conditions of Use or this Privacy Policy.
To communicate with you regarding your use of our Service
We communicate with you, for example, by push notifications. These may include reminders and motivational messages encouraging you to follow your training and nutrition plan, or other information about the App. As a result, you may, for example, receive a push notification every day at a particular time reminding you to work out.

To research and analyze your use of the Service
This helps us to better understand our business, analyze our operations, maintain, improve, innovate, plan, design, and develop the App and our new products. We also use such data for statistical analysis purposes, to test and improve our offers. This enables us to better understand what features and training plans of the App our users like more, what categories of users use our App. As a consequence, we often decide how to improve the App based on the results obtained from this processing. For example, if we discover that users more often engage in workouts designated for legs, we may develop and introduce a new workout for this area into the App.
