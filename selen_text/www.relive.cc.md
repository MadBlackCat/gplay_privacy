Privacy Statement
Relive B.V. protects your personal data and privacy. In this privacy statement, we tell you which personal data we collect and in what way we store and use it. This privacy statement applies to our website www.relive.cc (the Website), our application listed in the Apple Store and Google Play Store (the Application) and the services we provide. If you are under 16 years of age you need prior permission of your parents or legal guardians to use the website or Application.
Why we process personal data
To provide our service
In order to start using Relive, you need to sign up and create an account. In this step you provide us with information such as your name, email address and a profile picture (optional). We use this personal data (account data) so that you can log in to Relive, to personalize the service and so that we know how to address you when we contact you. If you sign up via Facebook, Google or WeChat, we will receive information from your profile to create a Relive account. If you cancel during any way of signing up, we cannot start providing you with the Relive service and will not save the data you entered.
When you connect a third party provider, like Endomondo or Garmin, you allow us to retrieve and store information from their service on your behalf including your profile information on the third party service in order to fill and update your Relive profile. You also allow us to process activity data from those third parties.
We process your activity data such as your tracked route, photos you upload and other information you add to the activity to create your Personal Video or for instance a personal heatmap.
The Personal Video, together with other activity information such as photos and moments is shared in the activity feed of users who follow you on Relive. You can control who follows you on Relive via your privacy settings. You can change this setting at any time.
We may also use anonymized aggregated data to create additional features within our service. For instance, aggregated activity data can be used to generate route recommendations or to create a heatmap.
Note that when you use Relive via a third party tracker the activity data can include your heart rate, we are not able to delete this info as it is often embedded in the received activity data.
You can upgrade your personal account and use a premium service of Relive (Relive Club). To bring you Relive Club we process your contact- and credit card details, we don’t process any payment information at all if you pay via Apple or Google.
To improve and protect our service
We process data on how you use our service such as the features you use, the actions you take and the time, frequency and duration of your usage. We also store non-personal data, such as: the type of your browser, the type of your computer and technical information on how you are reaching our website or app. This helps us to improve our service and to quickly detect crashes and bugs so that we can fix them.
To contact you
We use your information to communicate with you about our service (e.g.: when you’ve forgotten your password or when your video is ready), to help you use our service and to update you about our service and share other information we think you like*. We also use your information to respond to you when you contact us. You can manage your contact settings on your profile.
* Healthkit activity data will not be used for this purpose.
What data do we share?
We do not share or sell personally identifiable information (such as name, email) directly with other companies for marketing purposes. We do share Personal Information with vendors (data-processors) who are performing services for Relive, such as the servers for our email communications who are provided access to user's email address for purposes of sending emails from us.
We also utilize external services to help us improve the Relive Website and service. For example, we currently use Google Analytics (traffic analysis), and Wufoo (contact forms). These parties may also use cookies and tracking technologies. Feel free to check out their own Privacy Policies to find out more about how they work.
In the event we undergo a business transaction such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your Personal Information may be among the assets transferred. You acknowledge and consent that such transfers may occur and are permitted by this Privacy Statement, and that any acquirer of our assets may continue to process your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Statement.
We might also share personal information you have provided to us without your consent, in case we believe:
it's needed to detect, prevent or address fraud, security or technical issues;
it's needed to otherwise protect our property, legal rights, or that of others.
Your personal information may be processed outside the EU. We make sure that they all have suitable data protection safeguards and documentation of it, such as being part of the EU-US privacy shield. We have GDPR compliant Data Processing Agreements in place with our data-processors. Personal data stored at data-processors is removed according to our data retention policy which is described below.
Privacy Zone
Some third party applications allow you to create a ‘privacy zone’, which will hide your exact location within this zone. Please note that not all third party applications accurately share this information with us, but rather give us the unfiltered data. If you see your route within your privacy zone you must contact your third party service provider to stop sharing locations within your privacy zone.

Relive users who follow you have access to your profile page and activity information. You can control who is allowed to follow you via your privacy settings.
If your account is public, your profile page and activities are publicly visible.
