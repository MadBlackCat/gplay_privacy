The Twitch Services are also not available to any users previously removed from the Twitch Services by Twitch. Finally, the Twitch Services are not available to any persons barred from receiving them under the laws of the United States (such as its export and re-export restrictions and regulations) or applicable laws in any other jurisdiction.
BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, OR OTHERWISE USING THE TWITCH SERVICES, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU ARE AT LEAST 13 YEARS OF AGE, THAT YOUR PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN AGREES TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS OF SERVICE IF YOU ARE BETWEEN 13 AND THE AGE OF LEGAL MAJORITY IN YOUR JURISDICTION OF RESIDENCE, AND THAT YOU HAVE NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY REMOVED FROM OR PROHIBITED FROM RECEIVING THE TWITCH SERVICES.

d. Applicable Law and Venue
(i) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you and Twitch agree that if you are a Subscribing Organization or a consumer resident of a jurisdiction other than those in (ii) below, the following governing law and arbitration provision applies:
PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH TWITCH AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM TWITCH.
You and Twitch agree to arbitrate any dispute arising from these Terms of Service or your use of the Twitch Services, except that you and Twitch are not required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable and other relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets, or patents. ARBITRATION PREVENTS YOU FROM SUING IN COURT OR FROM HAVING A JURY TRIAL. You and Twitch agree that you will notify each other in writing of any dispute within thirty (30) days of when it arises. Notice to Twitch shall be sent to Twitch Interactive, Inc., Attn: Legal, 350 Bush Street, 2nd Floor, San Francisco, CA 94104. You and Twitch further agree: to attempt informal resolution prior to any demand for arbitration; that any arbitration will occur in Santa Clara County, California; that arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of JAMS; and that the state or federal courts in Santa Clara County, California have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals of an arbitration award and over any suit between the parties not subject to arbitration. Other than class procedures and remedies discussed below, the arbitrator has the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court. Any dispute between the parties will be governed by this Agreement and the laws of the State of California and applicable United States law, without giving effect to any conflict of laws principles that may provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction. Whether the dispute is heard in arbitration or in court, you and Twitch will not commence against the other a class action, class arbitration or other representative action or proceeding.
(ii)     If you are a resident in any jurisdiction in which the provision in the section above is found to be unenforceable, then the following shall apply:
Any disputes, claims or causes of action arising out of or in connection with these Terms of Service will be governed by and construed under the laws of the jurisdiction of your residence. 
Any disputes, claims or causes of action arising out of or in connection with these Terms of Service shall be resolved by competent civil courts within your jurisdiction of residence.

If we fail to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service, it will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Any waiver of any provision of these Terms of Service will be effective only if in writing and signed by the relevant party.
b. Severability.
If any provision of these Terms of Service or any Guidelines is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated from these Terms of Service to the minimum extent necessary and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
c. Assignment.
These Terms of Service and related Guidelines, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Twitch without restriction. Any assignment attempted to be made in violation of this Terms of Service shall be void.

18. Specific Terms for Twitch Sings
Twitch Sings (“Twitch Sings”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a free-to-play singing game and streamer tool, available on PC, iOS, and Android. It allows anyone to sing rights-cleared music privately or live on their personal Twitch channel, and to create and share VODs with users of Twitch and other users of Twitch Sings. All game activity can be streamed to Twitch without any additional software.

Sing a song start to finish, perform a duet, or go live within a concert setting to hundreds of cheering fans.  Bonus: if you use the Twitch Sings feature that allows you to live stream your performance to Twitch, emotes from chat will rise from the audience, while follows, cheers and subscription notices are highlighted with alerts and in-concert effects.

Before you stage dive on top of screaming fans, several guidelines:
Sing the song lyrics as displayed in the app or, when song lyrics are not displayed, to the best of your knowledge;
Avoid altering the fundamental character of any song included in Twitch Sings; and
Behave (in rock parlance: don’t trash the hotel room).  Conduct yourself in accordance with the Community Guidelines and these Terms of Service.
To make available musical works from a variety of artists within Twitch Sings (from rock to pop), Twitch negotiated licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new musical tracks.  The licenses granted to Twitch allow Twitch to use the works, and offer them to you for use, solely in connection with Twitch Sings and the Twitch Services. Twitch Sings content has not been cleared for use outside the Twitch Services. What this means is that, in your new rock-n-roll lifestyle, do not:
make unauthorized use of the copyrighted elements of a Twitch Sings song (including the use of the story of a song in another creative work);
assert copyright ownership of the songs (or any arrangements of the songs) provided in Twitch Sings; or
use your performance from Twitch Sings outside the Twitch Services, with the exception that you can use the YouTube exporter tool offered on Twitch.  However, you may not exercise any rights to claim or monetize any exported content, or block, dispute, interfere with, or suppress any attempts by a music rights holder (such as a music publisher who controls the song you recorded) to claim or monetize the exported content.
Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.  

Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.  Thus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Twitch Sings at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws). This may mean that Twitch will be required to take down previously recorded performances. Twitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Twitch Sings.
