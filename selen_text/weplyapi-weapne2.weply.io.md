Article 7 Technical/administrative measures for protecting personal data
(1) In processing personal data, the Company may take reasonable safety measures to ensure that personal data is not lost, stolen, leaked, altered, or damaged. The Company may use the following technical measures for such purpose.
① A Member’s personal data is protected by password and encrypted information. Even with these safety measures, there is still a high possibility that a Member’s password or personal data may be leaked to others if a Member accesses the Internet in a public area or through other means. As such, what is most important is to thoroughly protect the personal data of the Members as much as possible. Therefore, all Members should also be careful not to leak or provide their personal data to others, and take responsibility in managing their personal data. The Company is not responsible for problems that may arise from the Member’s own negligence or the inherent dangers of using the internet.
② Fundamentally, the Members’ personal data is protected by password and encrypted information. Files and transferred data are encrypted and important data is protected by separate security features.
③ The Company uses anti-virus software to prevent damages that arise from computer viruses and regularly updates the software.
④ To prevent leakage or damage of Members’ personal data from hackings, computer viruses, and other sources of intrusion, the Company maintains a 24-hour intrusion detection and intrusion prevention system that monitors possible threats from outside sources.
(2) The Company recognizes the importance of protecting personal data, so we limit the number of employees who process personal data to only those that are necessary. The Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) regularly educates/trains these employees to ensure the protection of the Members’ personal data. Also, the Company regularly reviews the relevant employees’ compliance with the provisions of this Privacy Policy, and where a violation is found, the Company orders the employees to correct/improve the violation and take any other necessary measures.
