Exception: the information NOT collected by UCWeb
Websites may require your information when you are browsing. For example when you visit online map or search engine, it may requests your location information. When you are trying to upload attachment to your mailbox, it may request to read your files. Your phone may pop-up as UC Browser requests your permission, but the information was NEVER received by UCWeb but sent to the website you visited directly.
It will be up to you to decide to give such permission or not. Yet please understand that if you deny such permissions, certain functions may be disabled. For example if you do not allow UC Browser to access to your location information, online map will not know where you are and search engine will not be able to provide location based search results; if you do not allow UC Browser to read your files, you may not upload attachments to your mailbox. You can always manage the permissions via your phone setting.
