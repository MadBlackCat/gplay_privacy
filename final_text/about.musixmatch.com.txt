Moreover, by logging in through your Facebook or Google account and based on your privacy settings on such social media, your profile picture will automatically become the photo associated with your Musixmatch account.

We also inform you that, by associating an account run by a social media website to your account and authorizing us to access such information, you accept that we could collect, use and save the data provided by these social media websites pursuant to this Policy.
We also might use plug-ins or other technologies from various social media websites. If you click on a connection provided through a social media plug-in, a connection with the relevant social media is automatically established.
External providers – We rely on external providers to handle payments, for example when you purchase a service or subscribe to Musixmatch. In such case, service providers share with Musixmatch some payment data to help us handle them and ensure you receive a service compliant with the Terms and conditions of use.
Websites and apps that use our services – Musixmatch can also collect data during the user’s visit to a website powered by any other company on behalf of Musixmatch, through automatic tools for data collection such as Web beacon, cookies and embedded web links. Those tools collect standard data on the web traffic the browser sends to the Musixmatch website, the browser’s type and language, time of access and internet address from which the Musixmatch website was accessed. They can also collect data on the IP address, unique identification of the device used, clickstream behaviour (that is pages visited, links opened and other activities of the user on “powered by” websites) and products. Musixmatch can also use some of those automatic tools for data collection through e-mails and communications from Musixmatch, collecting data when the user opens a message or clicks on a link in the message.
