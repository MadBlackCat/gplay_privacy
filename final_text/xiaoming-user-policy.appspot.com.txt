Case Study
We collect only the usage statistics needed to retain or improve the quality of our service.
If Sally is traveling in the UK, and logs onto US Streaming, we will not know, nor log which IP address was her original address, but we do know which of our servers was accessed by an anonymous XiaomingVPN customer, what time that server was accessed, how long that server was used and how much aggregate data was transferred during this time.
We may know that a XiaomingVPN customer accessed one of our servers, but we DO NOT and CANNOT know HOW and WHO accessed our service.
At XiaomingVPN, we remain committed to the right to privacy online for all.
You may contact us at qianbian58@gmail.com to obtain additional information about retention of your Personal Data.
