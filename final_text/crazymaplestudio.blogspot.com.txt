Parents be warned, I am a parent writing this review. I had my 14 year old daughter ask me " mommy, how should I do her hair"? Scrolling at the top was a conversation which was stating such vulgarity like eat my pu..., F word repeatedly and so many other vulgar words. The rating says 12+ this,is an absolute lie, poor development and design. We would see why kids in these United States have no moral compass, no respect and decency. I had this discussion with my child and she deleted the app, unfortunately I had to download in order,to,give this review.

I’m 14 and I’ve heard worse in school. If you don’t want your daughter playing it then don’t let her but it’s all just a story. Books may say similar things. So it’s ridiculous that you have to leave a review like this. She’s 14 and could more than likely chose to play this game. It’s the same as her picking up and reading a book with profanity in it. Don’t slam the autors of the chapters provided. It’s their app and they can do as they please with thier app. You don’t want your child to play it. Don’t let her.

If you try to make a purchase of diamonds it will come up "purchase complete" then close the game down when you go back into the game the items purchased are not there, thankfully I haven't been charged despite it saying "purchase successful"

I'm liking this app better than CHOICES app. More rewards & we can reread without costing us tickets/keys & its way less wait to get new tickets (2 hours to wait per key on CHOICES is absurd). BUT some of the stories here are poorly done, or they get really good then abruptly end. Some you can only end on good notes if you pay for the choices, and in HIS it's all kinds of stupid how the endings are played out. As well, Bad boy blues you can only keep your man if you pay for the choice. New book Zombies...so funny until it started costing diamonds & I stopped reading it. Another book does that too so I just won't read it either. Not cool. Also, suddenly all the new updates are not compatible with my iPad?? Now I am missing out on some of the extra benefits. Overall I still like it & it definitely is better than CHAPTERS which I read way less than I read this. ���� I like being able to earn diamonds & incentives and not having to wait hours in keys/tickets just to reread a book already completed.

Then when I have over $60 in my account I get charged for $42 for 2x 1.49 and still get fucking nothing. I have taken photos of my account and purchases and want someone to fix this and refund the credit I paid for and got nothing.

So when you purchase extra tickets or diamonds they are advertised at one price you press confirm and the price is double just before you confirm with itunes... Why?

Any chance I could get a refund for the 500 diamonds I didn't receive I didn't check before if it didn't work but I love playing this game the only downside is you end up paying for things you didn't receive xx

I tried to purchase gems and tickets. The app malfunctioned and didn’t give me either so I thought I wasnt charged but I ended up with charges for a lot more money than I was even trying to spend. Please refund me!

My app keeps glitching so my purchases don’t download and iTunes won’t refund me my money.

I tried to buy gems and tickets and it said purchase complete then crashed so I tried again and it did it again - I've just checked my account and you have taken 4 X $7.99 out and I've received no diamonds or tickets?? Can you refund or give me the tickets or diamonds???? The game was Choises - otherwise I will be contacting my back to sue you for fraud...

Hi. I love your game but there's a problem when I try to view the cards that I recieve by completing a chapter or purchasing an exclusive choice, I can't seem to view them they only show me the game's name and not the card before when I used the app I could see the app but now I can't. Please fix this.

Love this app, although i think when u buy the outfits u should able to use then as a eardrobe on other games. And shouldnt have to wait 2 hours for a new ticket, can that get cut down to hourly?
