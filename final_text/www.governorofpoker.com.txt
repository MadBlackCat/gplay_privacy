“ALL THE DETAILS”
Azerion and third parties process personal data mostly with the help of cookies. To help you understand what this means, we will first describe the use of cookies on our website below. We will then explain how personal data is processed, including the use of those cookies.
How do we use cookies?
Cookies are small pieces of information (small files) stored on your equipment (such as your computer).  In this privacy policy, cookies also refer to the information collected by (third party) codes within the  gaming  apps (SDKs). As the website owner, we place cookies when you visit our website, as do the third-parties that we work with directly to deliver games and ads. While we control this process, you can use our consent tool to make choices about the cookies you wish to allow and the personal data processing that occurs with the help of those cookies. Because of the way online games and ads work, third parties with whom we do not work directly, but who also deliver games and ads via our website and apps, may also place cookies. This is not something we can control.
Below we describe which cookies Azerion uses, for what purpose, and the duration of their use.
1.1 Cookies that help to ensure that the website functions properly
Our website uses cookies:
to remember information you enter when you fill in forms or input fields on various pages. We do this so that you won’t have to enter all of this information again the next time you visit.
to store preferences such as language settings, location settings, the number of search results you wish to display per page, etc.
to store settings for optimal (video) display, such as the optimal or desired buffer size and information regarding your screen resolution.
to read your browser settings, ensuring that our website is displayed properly on your screen.
to detect abuse of our website and services, for instance by registering repeated failed attempts to log in.
to ensure an even load (page requests) across the website, allowing us to keep the website available to our visitors.
to offer the option to store login details so that you do not have to log in manually the next time you visit the website.
to enable you to interact with our website in a whole range of different ways, such as social media interaction, or leaving direct feedback.
1.2 Cookies allowing us to sell and show ads
Most of our domains/games/apps are provided free of charge. Advertising income is used to cover the costs. This means that ads are a vital source of income, and are necessary to keep the domains/games/apps running.
Some advertisements (or videos) use cookies. These ads are placed on our websites by us and/or media companies and advertising networks. Advertising networks and media companies function as a middleman between us as the website owner and advertisers.
These cookies ensure that it is possible to:
track which ads you have already seen, and prevent you from being shown the same ad over and over again.
track how many visitors click on an advertisement, so that we can balance the books with advertisers.
track how many orders are placed via the ads, so that we can balance the books with advertisers.
generate advertising segments, contextual groups and profiling  categories, this enables us to deliver content which is relevant to your interests, and more appropriate to you as an audience
Please note that you will still be shown advertisements even if these cookies are not used. After all, we also display ads that do not use cookies.

1.3 Cookies that allow us to gather information about the way visitors use our website/app
To find out which sections of our website our visitors like best, we continually try to measure how many visitors our website/app attracts and which pages they view most often. To do this, we use our own cookies and/or those provided by third parties.
The information we gather in this manner is used to generate statistics. These statistics provide us with insights into how often visitors come to our web pages and/or app, which pages/feature they spend the most time viewing and/or playing, how often they interact with (part of) a page/app, and so on. This allows us to make the structure, navigation, and content of our website/apps as user-friendly as possible.
We do not trace our statistics and other reports back to individual people.
We use cookies to
keep track of the number of visitors on our webpages/app.
keep track of the amount of time visitors spend on our webpages/apps.
determine the order in which a visitor views/use the various pages/features belonging to our website/app.
determine which parts of our website (or pages) or apps need to be adjusted.
optimise the website/apps (or parts of it).

1.4 Cookies to share the content of our website via social media
The games that you play (on our website) can be shared via social media by clicking on a number of different social media buttons. To enable these buttons to work properly, we use social media cookies provided by various social media platforms. These cookies allow the social media platforms that you wish to use to recognise you when you want to share something with your friends. In other words, these cookies allow users who are logged in to the selected social media platforms to share certain content from our website directly.  
For more information regarding the cookies used by these social media platforms and the data these parties collect using those cookies, we refer you to the terms and conditions applicable to these platforms as listed on their own websites.
Please see the social media websites listed below to view the terms and conditions that may apply. (Please note, however, that these terms and conditions may be subject to change without notice.) We do not have any influence on these separate terms and conditions.

1.5 Cookies used to increase the relevance of the content of the website
We aim to provide our visitors with relevant information. That is why we work to tailor our website/app to each visitor’s needs and interest.

In order to adjust the website/app to reflect your interests more accurately, we try to get an impression of the things you like based on the websites you have previously visited. In doing so, we do not construct a profile that can be traced to any individual person. We tailor the content and the ads shown on our website to different groups of visitors. On the basis of your online history, you may be put into a certain category, such as “women aged 35-45, married, with children, interested in ballet”. This group will, of course, be shown different ads than the group “men aged 20-30, unmarried, interested in cooking”.

Third parties (advertisers) who place cookies via our website/app may use similar technologies to find out what interests you. In this case, information about your current visit to the website may be combined with information from earlier visits to other websites besides our own.

When such cookies are not used, this does not mean that you will no longer be shown any ads on our websites. Instead, the ads will just be less likely to match your interests.

These cookies make it possible:
for websites to register your visit in order to try to guess what you might be interested in.
to register whether you clicked on an advertisement (i.e. click-through behaviour).
to pass on information about your browsing behaviour to other websites.
to use services provided by third parties to display ads (re-targeted marketing).
to show more interesting ads based on your social media usage (i.e. social media behaviour).

  1.5 Other/unforeseen
Because of the way the internet,websites and apps work, it may be that we do not always have insight into the cookies that third parties place via our website/app. This is especially the case if our web pages and/or apps contain so-called embedded elements. These are games or sdk’s that are stored with another party, but which are shown on, in, or via our website/app.
If you encounter cookies on this website that fall into this category, and do not correspond to the previous categories described above, please let us know. You can also contact the third party directly and ask which cookies they place on your device, why they do this, and what personal data they process with the cookie. You may also wish to ask what the lifespan of the cookie is and what safeguards they have taken to protect your privacy.
