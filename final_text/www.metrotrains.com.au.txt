PRIVACY POLICY
Metro Trains Melbourne Pty Ltd (“Metro”, “we”, “our” or “us”) ABN 43 136 429 948, is committed to protecting the privacy of individuals. The protection of personal information in the private sector is required by the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) and the Privacy and Data Protection Act 2014 (Vic) (collectively the “Privacy Laws”) and we are bound to comply with these Privacy Laws. All of our employees and officers are expected to comply with the Privacy Laws and our policies and procedures concerning the protection of personal information.
WHAT IS PERSONAL INFORMATION?
“Personal Information” means information or an opinion about an individual whose identity is apparent, or can reasonably be ascertained, from the information or opinion. Information contained in publications which are generally available is not regarded as “Personal Information” for privacy purposes. Our policies regarding the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information and Sensitive Information are summarised in this Privacy Policy. This Policy does not apply to the records for current or former employees of Metro as the relevant privacy policy for such records is covered in a separate document.
This policy is based on the following principles:
Privacy of Personal Information is of paramount importance to us;
your Personal Information will not be disclosed, other than in accordance with this policy without your permission or in accordance with the Privacy Laws; and
We will only use your Personal Information for purposes for which it was collected, as set out in this policy.
WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?
We may collect Personal Information about you, including your name, date of birth, address, telephone number and email address. We may also collect information concerning your use of our services and other information or opinions concerning our dealings with you. We do not collect or disclose government related identifiers such as drivers licence numbers unless it is reasonably necessary, such as for proof of identity or legal purposes. Where a name is not required for legal, practical or other reasons, you may transact with Metro without identifying yourself or by using a pseudonym such as a social media moniker.
HOW DO WE COLLECT PERSONAL INFORMATION?
Metro will collect information directly from you unless:
We have your consent for information to be collected from a third party;
We are required or authorised by law; or
It is impracticable to do so.
Metro will obtain your consent prior to collecting any Sensitive Information unless certain legal and/or safety-related exemptions set out in the Privacy Laws apply. We therefore collect Personal Information through a variety of ways. These include:
Directly from you, for example when you provide information via our website, on an application form or when speaking to our representatives;
From third parties, for example credit reporting agencies, your agents or Public Transport Victoria (“PTV”);
Via CCTV monitoring on our stations and trains;
From publicly available sources; and
From our records of your dealings with us (including through your use of our website). If you provide us with the Personal Information of another person, we rely on you to inform that person and obtain their consent for the disclosure by you to us of their Personal Information.
UNSOLICITED PERSONAL INFORMATION
Where unsolicited Personal Information is received by Metro, we will determine, within a reasonable period of time, whether or not we would be permitted to collect the information under the Privacy Laws. If it would not be permitted for Metro to collect the information, we will destroy the information or ensure it is de-identified as soon as practicable.
WHY DO WE COLLECT AND HOW DO WE USE PERSONAL INFORMATION
Metro only collects Personal Information where it is reasonably necessary for one or more of its functions or activities and it is collected by lawful and fair means. Metro will not collect more information than is necessary or relevant. We will not collect sensitive information (as defined in the Privacy Laws), such as racial or ethnicity information, political opinions or associations, criminal records or health information unless we have obtained your prior consent. If your Personal Information is collected from someone other than you, reasonable steps will be made as soon as is practicable to notify you that we have collected the information and the circumstances of the collection. We may collect and use your Personal Information in order to:
undertake and operate our franchise in line with our Franchise Agreement with the State Government;
provide specific services to you, or to carry out our dealings with you;
provide feedback to you; • comply with our legal obligations;
conduct market research in order to evaluate and improve our services, communications and marketing;
review and consider any application or other information you send to us;
evaluate and manage the engagement of contractors and consultants;
carry out administrative functions, such as risk management, credit management, billing and record keeping;
investigate and respond to safety, security and/or unlawful incidents on the metropolitan rail network;
monitor and enforce our policies and procedures to ensure that our services used in a safe and lawful manner;
test, develop and maintain our systems and services;
assess any job application in Metro for which you may have applied; and
carry out credit and payment related activities.
If all or part of the information we seek to collect is not provided, we may not be able to complete one or more of the specific tasks identified in the above list.
