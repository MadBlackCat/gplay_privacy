Web Beacons (if applicable)
Our webpages include electronic images (known as a "pixel GIF" or a "beacon") that allow the website to calculate the number of webpage users or users that have saved a certain cookie. The ways in which the StreamKar community uses beacons include:
Beacons used within the StreamKar community
The StreamKar community uses beacons on the website to calculate the total number of users and to identify registered users using saved StreamKar community cookies.
We are able to provide customized webpage services when you are on non-6.cn websites by saving StreamKar community cookies.
Web beacons are used outside of the StreamKar community domain
The StreamKar community uses website beacons to collect data for partner websites; relevant data is also used for statistical purposes.
The StreamKar community user data recorded by website beacons are compiled and made available to our partners as aggregate data for reference purposes. Aggregate data includes information such as user count and usage, but does not include any personally identifiable data.
When the StreamKar community places website beacons to collect data for our partners, we require our partners to inform users on their privacy policy page that the webpage uses website beacons.
NB. This option will only be recorded in your current browser and will not be recorded in your user history. Therefore, to completely block the beacon, you must click on the above link on all of your computers and browsers.
HTML Emails
The StreamKar community typically adds a beacon when sending emails in HTML format (emails containing images) to count the number of opened messages.
Typically, electronic images are considered to be part of the webpage and, including banner ads, can all be used as beacons. Therefore, beacons can be added to all advertisements placed by the StreamKar community.
The StreamKar community tracks certain usage behavior. Information collected from web beacons are used to understand how customers use our products, provide more accurate reports and enhance the effectiveness of our marketing.
Editing Personal Account Information and Preferences
At any time, you have the right to edit your StreamKar community account information and preferences, including whether you would like to receive information on the latest products from the StreamKar community.
Security Safeguards
Your StreamKar community account is password protected to ensure the security of your privacy and information.
Under certain conditions, the StreamKar community uses the universally accepted SSL encryption system to ensure the security of information transfer.
Amendments to the Privacy Policy
The StreamKar community periodically makes changes to the privacy policy. If there are significant changes to the privacy policy, we will promptly notify users by posting the relevant terms in a prominent position on the webpage.
