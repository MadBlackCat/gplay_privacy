1. Introduction
Welcome to Gaia GPS! Your use of Gaia GPS’s services, including the services Gaia GPS makes available through this website and any other software or services offered by Gaia GPS in connection therewith (the "Services") is governed by these terms of service (the "Terms"), so please carefully read them before using the Services. For the purposes of these Terms, "we," "our," "us," and "Gaia GPS" refer to TrailBehind, Inc., the providers and operators of the Services.

In order to use the Services, you must first agree to these Terms. If you are registering for or using the Services on behalf of an organization, you are agreeing to these Terms for that organization and promising that you have the authority to bind that organization to these Terms. In that case, "you" and "your" will also refer to that organization, wherever possible.

You must be over 13 years of age to use the Services, and children under the age of 13 cannot use or register for the Services. If you are over 13 years of age but are not yet of legal age to form a binding contract (in many jurisdictions, this age is 18), then you must get your parent or guardian to read these Terms and agree to them for you before you use the Services. If you are a parent or guardian and you provide your consent to your child's registration with the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms with respect of your child’s use of the Services.

You agree your purchases and/or use of the Services are not contingent on the delivery of any future functionality or features or dependent on any oral or written public comments made by Gaia GPS or any of its affiliates regarding future functionality or features.

BY USING, DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, OR OTHERWISE ACCESSING THE SERVICES OR ANY MATERIALS INCLUDED IN OR WITH THE SERVICES, YOU HEREBY AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THESE TERMS, THEN YOU MAY NOT USE, DOWNLOAD, INSTALL, OR OTHERWISE ACCESS THE SERVICES.

2. Your Account
In the course of registering for or using the Services, you may be required to provide Gaia GPS with certain information, including your name, organization name, email, and password ("Credentials"). Gaia GPS handles such information with the utmost attention, care and security. Nonetheless, you, not Gaia GPS, shall be responsible for maintaining and protecting your Credentials in connection with the Services. If your contact information or other information relating to your account changes, you must notify Gaia GPS promptly and keep such information current. You are solely responsible for any activity using your Credentials, whether or not you authorized that activity. You should immediately notify Gaia GPS of any unauthorized use of your Credentials or if your email or password has been hacked or stolen. If you discover that someone is using your Credentials without your consent, or you discover any other breach of security, you agree to notify Gaia GPS immediately.

If an organization invited or otherwise provided you with your account, that organization may have rights to your account and may: manage your account, reset your password, or suspend or cancel your account; view your account's usage and profile data, including how and when your account is used; and read or store Content in your account. If you are an individual user of the Services, and the domain of the primary email address associated with your account is owned by an organization and was assigned to you as an employee, contractor or member of such organization, and that organization wishes to establishes a commercial relationship with us and add your account to such relationship, then, if you do not change the email address associated with your account, your account may become subject to the commercial relationship between Gaia GPS and such organization and controlled by such organization.

3. Content
A variety of information, reviews, recommendations, messages, comments, posts, text, graphics, software, photographs, videos, data, maps, and other materials ("Content") may be made available through the Services by Gaia GPS or its suppliers ("Gaia GPS-Supplied Content"). While Gaia GPS strives to keep the Content that it provides through the Services accurate, complete, and up-to-date, Gaia GPS cannot guarantee, and is not responsible for the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of any Gaia GPS-Supplied Content.

You acknowledge that you will be able to create, transmit, publish or display information (such as data files, written text, computer software, music, audio files or other sounds, photographs, videos or other images) through use of the Services. All such information is referred to below as "User Content."

You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Gaia GPS has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any User Content, and for the consequences of your actions (including any loss or damage which Gaia GPS may suffer) in connection with such User Content. If you are registering for these Services on behalf of an organization, you also agree that you are also responsible for the actions of associated Users and for any User Content that such associated Users might upload, record, publish, post, link to, or otherwise transmit or distribute through use of the Services.Furthermore, you acknowledge that Gaia GPS does not control or actively monitor Content uploaded by users and, as such, does not guarantee the accuracy, integrity or quality of such Content. You acknowledge that by using the Services, you may be exposed to materials that are offensive, indecent or objectionable. Under no circumstances will Gaia GPS be liable in any way for any such Content. You will: (a) be solely responsible for the nature, quality and accuracy of your User Content; (b) ensure that your User Content (including the storage or transmission thereof) complies with these Terms and any and all applicable laws, and regulations; (c) promptly handle and resolve any notices and claims relating to your User Content, including any notices sent to you by any person claiming that any User Content violates any person's rights, such as take-down notices pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and any other notices; and (d) maintain appropriate security, protection and backup copies of your User Content, which may include, your use of additional encryption technology to protect the Content from unauthorized access.

Gaia GPS may refuse to store, provide, or otherwise maintain your User Content for any or no reason. Gaia GPS may remove your User Content from the Services at any time if you violate these Terms or if the Services are canceled or suspended. If User Content is stored using the Services with an expiration date, Gaia GPS may also delete the User Content as of that date. User Content that is deleted may be irretrievable. You agree that Gaia GPS will have no liability of any kind as a result of the deletion of, correction of, destruction of, damage to, loss of or failure to store or encrypt any User Content. Gaia GPS recommends that You backup all User Content, including, but not limited to, important waypoints, tracks, and photo waypoints. You acknowledge that User Content you may store or access through the Services may be subject to inadvertent damage, corruption or loss.

Gaia GPS reserves the right (but shall have no obligation) to remove User Content from the Services, in its discretion. You agree to immediately take down any Content that violates these Terms, including pursuant to a takedown request from Gaia GPS. In the event that you elect not to comply with a request from Gaia GPS to take down certain Content, Gaia GPS reserves the right to directly take down such Content.

Subject to the limitations set forth in this paragraph, by submitting, posting or otherwise uploading User Content on or through the Services you give Gaia GPS a worldwide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to reproduce, adapt, modify, translate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display and distribute such User Content for the purpose of enabling Gaia GPS to provide you with the Services, and for the limited purposes stated in our Privacy Policy. In particular, You authorize Gaia GPS to remove any copyright management information ("CMI") included in the User Content and to distribute such User Content without CMI. You will have the option to make User Content available to other Gaia GPS users or to restrict access to your User Content. User Content that you properly select to be restricted to only your use and access shall be referred to as "Private User Content." User Content that you fail to properly select to be restricted to only your use and access, that you have opted to "publish" or make "public," that you have failed to opt out of the "publish" option or opt out of making such User Content "public," or that you otherwise indicated (by act or omission) that such User Content may be made available to other users shall be referred to as "Public User Content." With respect to any Public User Content, you assign Gaia GPS all right, title, and interest to such Public User Content. With respect to any Private User Content, Gaia GPS will not make such Private User Content available to other Gaia GPS Users; provided, however, you agree that Gaia GPS may use such Private User Content, in an anonymized manner, to provide data to Gaia GPS Users as to the popularity of existing features on maps, such as trails and points of interest. You understand and acknowledge that Gaia GPS may use both opt in and/or opt out methods of selecting whether some or all of your User Content be designated Private User Content or Public User Content and you agree that You shall be responsible for ensuring that Your User Content is designated in accordance with your wishes. Gaia GPS shall have no responsibility or liability based on your failure to appropriately opt out or opt into your preferred privacy settings.
