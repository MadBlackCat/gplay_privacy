Personal and non-personal information help us improve the quality of our products, services, and content, and/or technically manage our website or applications (including but not limited to logging your IP address to monitor traffic). We will never disclose your IP address to a third party.

We retain your data for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you the Service. We will, for example, periodically de-identify unused game accounts and we regularly review and de-identify unnecessary data.

We have taken appropriate steps and followed industry standards to secure all personal data stored in our systems. All transactions processed in are being kept with the highest security level protocols, ensuring that no one can access or use personal information in an unauthorized manner. In order to help ensure a secure and safe player experience, we are continuously developing and implementing administrative, technical and physical security measures to protect your data from unauthorized access or against loss, misuse or alteration.

However, while we take responsible measures to protect your personal information, the internet is not a 100% secure environment.
