Privacy Policy
  INTRODUCTION
Zonmob Game Studio ("ZONMOB" or "we") is dedicated to protecting the privacy rights of our online users ("users" or "you"). This Privacy Policy has been crafted to inform you as to the ways we collect, store, use, and manage the information you provide in connection with any ZONMOB's game or Application. Please note that the scope of this Privacy Policy is limited to only information collect from ZONMOB through use of the Service. By using the service, you are agreeing to the collection and use of your personal information as outline in this Privacy Policy. We may amend the Privacy Policy from time to time, and we encourage you to consult the Privacy Policy regularly for changer.
  COLLECT INFORMATION
When you use any ZONMOB Service, also sometimes referred to as an "Application" or "App", you get access to its online community within that Service and you allow ZONMOB to access certain information about you. The information you allow we to access varies by Application, and it is affected by the privacy settings you and your friends establish in that Application. Users can always refuse to supply personally identification information, except that it may prevent them from engaging in certain App related activities.
There are two types of information we may collect through your use of our:
1. "Personal Information", which is the type of information that specifically identifies you personally and/or can be used alone to contact you online or offline, such as: your full name, physical address, email address, telephone number, photograph, precise geolocation information (i.e., your specific location), ZONMOB's game player ID, credit card information and, in some cases, usernames.
2. "Non-Personal Information", which is information that does not identify you and cannot be used to contact you personally, including information about you such as your date of birth, age, ZIP code, non-precise geolocation information (e.g., your city), and gender, as well as information about your computer and mobile device, such as your unique device ID, Internet Protocol (IP) address, or other persistent identifiers, and their hardware/software/firmware. Non-Personal Information also includes "Usage Data," which is anonymous data tied to your computer and/or device, such as the actions you take within and outside of the Websites/Apps, the browser you use, the identity of other Apps included on your device, the date and time of your use of the Websites/Apps, your game progress, play time, score and achievements, and the URLs you visited and/or Apps you used before and after using our Websites/Apps.
