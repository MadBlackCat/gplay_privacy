Rectification
You can ask us to rectify inaccurate personal data. We may seek to verify the accuracy of the data before rectifying it.
Erasure
You can ask us to erase your personal data, but only where:
路        it is no longer needed for the purposes for which it was collected; or
路        you have withdrawn your consent (where the data processing was based on consent); or

Objection
You can object to any processing of your personal data which has our legitimate interests as its legal basis (see Section 3 or contact us for further details), if you believe your fundamental rights and freedoms outweigh our legitimate interests. Once you have objected, we have an opportunity to demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate interests which override your rights.
Automated Decision Making
You can ask not to be subject to a decision which is based solely on automated processing (see Section 8), but only where that decision:
路        produces legal effects concerning you (such as the rejection of a claim); or

In such situations, you can obtain human intervention in the decision making, and we will ensure measures are in place to allow you to express your point of view, and / or contest the automated decision.

路        Third Party Rights. We do not have to comply with a request where it would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of other Data Subjects.
