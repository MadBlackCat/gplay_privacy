Privacy Policy
This privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy") describes how Unisoft Games LTD. ("Mobile Apps" or "we" or "us") uses personal information in running our business. Mobile Apps is available from our websites, including but not limited to, www.gamesunisoft.org ("Websites") and mobile applications ("Mobile Apps"). We refer to our Website visitors and Mobile App users as users ("Users") of Mobile Apps's Services ("Services"). By visiting any of the Websites or using any of the Mobile Apps, you are accepting and consenting to the practices described in the Privacy Policy.
1. WHAT TYPES OF INFORMATION DOES Mobile Apps COLLECT?
User Provided Information. We obtain certain information when you provide it to us: for example, if you setup your account profile, participate in a discussion board or report a problem on one of the Websites, you may provide your name, email address, your date of birth, photograph, and a list of interests such as your favorite music and television shows. Some of that information can be used by Mobile Apps to identify or contact you directly and is sometimes referred to as personally identifiable information.
Information from Use of our Services. Mobile Apps also gathers non-personally identifiable information from Users of our Services. Non-personally identifiable information is information that usually cannot by itself be used to identify a particular person or entity, and may include: the Internet Protocol (IP) address, unique device identifiers, anonymous IDs for advertising, operating system, mobile network information, browser type, existing applications, browsing activity and non-precise device location information (e.g., city or region). Mobile Apps enables you to send messages to other Users in the Mobile Apps community. We ordinarily don't read the content of these messages unless we reasonably believe the Service is being misused or as required by law; we keep track of the number of messages sent and similar information to keep our Services running smoothly. Mobile Apps also enables you to 'friend' other members of the Mobile Apps community, and records which members of the community you've friended, which Mobile Apps groups you've joined, and what pieces of content you've uploaded via the Services.
Facebook Connect. When you choose to connect or login to Mobile Apps with your Facebook account, we can access certain information you've added on Facebook in order to provide a social and personalized experience while using the Service. We adhere to the Facebook Platform Policies which restrict how we may can access and use this information. If you log into our services via Facebook Connect, we collect information from your Facebook account, including but not limited to: your name, city, your birthday, your Facebook Connect ID, and the list of your Facebook friends.
Google +. When you choose to connect or login to Mobile Apps with Google +, we can access certain information you've added on Google + in order to provide a social and personalized experience while using the Service. We adhere to the Google + Platform Developer Policies , which restrict how we may can access and use this information. If you log into our services via Google +, we collect information from your Google + account, including but not limited to: your name, city, your birthday, and contacts.
Other Login Methods. Mobile Apps may also incorporate alternative log in methods not listed here, which may follow a similar protocol to the log in methods listed above.
Device Information. When you access the Services on your wireless device, we may obtain information from your wireless carrier about the type of device you are using. We may use this information to notify you about what type of features and products from Mobile Apps may be available to you on your device.
Mobile Phone Number. Certain features of the Services may require our collection of the phone number of your device. We may associate that phone number to the mobile device identification information. We will not use that number for telemarketing.
Location. Depending on the provider, we may automatically receive general location information when you use our Services. In the future, if we begin to offer Services that use technology that pinpoints precise geolocation, we will ensure that we have your consent (an opt-in) before doing so. We may use and store this information to provide enhanced location-based Services as well as to serve location-targeted advertising without your express opt-in, which includes communication to third party Services providers who have agreed with Mobile Apps to keep such information confidential and only use such information to the extent necessary to perform the Services as required by Mobile Apps.
Mobile Apps Beta Users. From time to time, Mobile Apps will offer to its users the opportunity to Beta test a new Mobile App or Mobile App feature. Participation is entirely voluntary. Users who elect to sign-up to Beta test these features are "Beta Users". Beta Users may be asked to provide additional personal information as part of the Beta test, such as precise geolocation, or will be able to access certain other features, such as making in-app purchases. For each Beta test, the Beta User will be provided with a disclosure about the data collection, use, and sharing practices specific to that Beta test, and will only be permitted to become a Beta User upon acceptance of those specific terms.
Cookies. Mobile Apps uses a number of cookies to collect non-personal information for many purposes. You can see a list of the cookies we use in our Cookie Policy. Please note that by using the Services you are consenting to the use of cookies.
In addition to other information described in this policy, we may collect and share precise location information, through methods such as mobile “SDKs”. This location information may be used by itself, aggregated, or combined with mobile identifiers (such as IDFAs and Android IDs), and shared with third parties, for purposes related to advertising, attribution (e.g., measuring ad performance) analytics and research. You can remove your consent to having your location data collected by changing the settings on your device.(Certain services may lose functionality as a result.)
You can opt-out from any interest-based advertising through your device settings. When you have opted out using this setting on a device, advertisers will not use in-app information collected from that device to infer your interests or serve ads to that device that are targeted based on your inferred interests.
2. HOW DOES Mobile Apps USE INFORMATION?
User Provided Information. We use the personally identifiable information in the file we maintain about you, and other information we obtain from your current and past activities on the Services to: deliver the products and services that you have requested, manage your account and provide you with customer support, communicate with you about products or services that may be of interest to you, and to monitor compliance with the rules governing the Services. We don't sell your personally identifiable information to third parties.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information from the use of our Services. Mobile Apps analyzes non-personally-identifying information gathered from users of the Services to help better understand how our Services are being used and to help tailor content and advertising across the Services. By recognizing patterns and trends in usage, Mobile Apps is able to better design the Services to improve Users' experiences, both in terms of content and ease of use. We also may share non-personally-identifying information with third parties, including but not limited to advisors, advertisers, analytics providers, and investors, for the purpose of conducting business.
Friend information - Mobile Apps enables you to 'friend' other members of the Mobile Apps community. Further information can be found in our online safety and best practices guidelines.

We offer you the ability to control the types of information that is available to friends, and to the public via the Services. As part of connecting you to your friends, we may search your phone's contacts for other friends using Mobile Apps who you may want to connect with and let you know who they are. However, we do not store the information from your phone's contact list on our servers.
