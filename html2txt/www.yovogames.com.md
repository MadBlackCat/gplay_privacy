**Routine Information Collection**  
All web servers track basic information about their visitors. This information
includes, but is not limited to, IP addresses, browser details, timestamps and
referring pages. None of this information can personally identify specific
visitors to this site. The information is tracked for routine administration
and maintenance purposes, and lets me know what pages and information are
useful and helpful to visitors.  
 **Cookies and Web Beacons**  
Where necessary, our apps uses cookies to store information about a visitor’s
preferences and history in order to better serve the visitor and/or present
the visitor with customized content. Advertising partners and other third
parties may also use cookies, scripts and/or web beacons to track visitors to
our site in order to display advertisements and other useful information. Such
tracking is done directly by the third parties through their own servers and
is subject to their own privacy policies.  
 **COPPA**  
We comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act. We do not
knowingly collect personal information on children under the age of 13. When a
user identifies himself or herself as a child under the age of 13 through a
support request or through any feedback, we will not collect, store or use,
and will delete in a secure manner, any personal information of such user.  
 **IN-APP PURCHASES** Our Apps enable in-app purchases. We do not process
payments for in-app purchases and not have access to your credit card
information. Payment transactions for in-app purchases are completed through
the app store via your app store account. Any post-purchase processes are
controlled by the app store and are subject to specific terms of such app
store.  
 **Controlling Your Privacy**  
Note that you can change your browser settings to disable cookies if you have
privacy concerns. Disabling cookies for all sites is not recommended as it may
interfere with your use of some sites. The best option is to disable or enable
cookies on a per-site basis. Consult your browser documentation for
instructions on how to block cookies and other tracking mechanisms.  
 **OPT-OUT**  
You are always free to opt out from the future collection of your personal
information by Yovo Studio Inc. in accordance with this Privacy Policy by

**2\. Via “Do Not Track Settings” in mobile phone**  
If you choose to opt out via “Do Not Track Settings” in your mobile phone all
providers of advertising services are bound to comply with such “Do Not Track”
setting, but we cannot provide any guarantees on their behalf. If you choose
the opt-out option available via our Apps, we will not share your advertising
ID with advertisers for the purposes of IBA. We provide no guarantees
regarding the information provided prior to opting out. Some providers may
have additional opt-out mechanisms implemented.  
If you turn on “Limit Ad Tracking” on your iOS device or “Opt Out of Interest-
Based Ads” on your Android device, you can restore interest-based ads by
turning the settings off. When you opt out, you may still see the same number
of ads on your mobile device; however, these ads may be less relevant because
they won’t be based on your interests. Our advertising partners may continue
to serve you ads based on other non-personal information, such as ads related
to the content of the application you are using.  
Your iOS or Android mobile device may provide a “Limit Ad Tracking” or “Opt
Out of Interest-Based Advertising” setting. When you have opted out using this
setting on a device, our partners will not use information collected from that
device to infer your interests, or to serve ads to that device that are
targeted based on your inferred interests.  
You can find the setting for your mobile device by following the directions
below, or contact your device provider. The reason for switching from device
IDs to Advertising Identifier is that advertisers are able to use this
identifier only for advertising and for no other purpose, while users can
choose to opt out of tracking via the settings of mobile phone. Advertising
Identifier is an anonymous identifier for advertising purposes which enables
users to reset their identifier or opt out of interest-based ads. The parties
participating in advertising are obligated to follow users’ choice for opting
out of tracking according to the app store guidelines.

Policy on our website, without directly informing our users. Therefore we

reserves all rights and interpretation to the Policy and its amendments.
