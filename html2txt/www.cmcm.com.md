  *  **Right of access and rectification.** If you request a copy of your personal information that we hold, we will provide you with a copy without undue delay and free of charge, except where we are permitted by law to charge a fee.

You may also request to correct or update any of your personal information held by us, unless you can already do so directly via the Services.

  *  **Right to erasure (the “Right to be Forgotten”).** You may request us to erase any of your personal information held by us that: is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise processed; was collected in relation to processing that you previously consented to, but later withdrew such consent; or was collected in relation to processing activities to which you object, and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for our processing.

  *  **Right to restriction.** You have the right to restrict our processing your personal information where one of the following applies:

    * You contest the accuracy of your personal information that we processed. We will restrict the processing of your personal information, which may result in an interruption of some or all of the Services, during the period necessary for us to verify the accuracy of your personal information;

    * The processing is unlawful and you oppose the erasure of your personal information and request the restriction of its use instead;

    * We no longer need your personal information for the purposes of the processing, but it is required by you to establish, exercise or defense of legal claims; or

  *  **Notification to third-parties.** If we share your personal information with third parties, we will notify them of any requests for rectification, erasure or restriction of your personal information, unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort. Upon your request, we will identify such third parties.

should not use the Services.

appropriate safeguards as permitted under the Data Protection Laws.
