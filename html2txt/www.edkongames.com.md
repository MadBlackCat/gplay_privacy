    * Even during purely informational use of the Internet applications, cookies are stored on your computer. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your hard drive and associated with the browser you use, and through which information is conveyed to the party that sets the cookie (in this case, the provider designated in section 4).

This allows the system to recognise your computer if you return to the Internet application again. As soon as you log out or close your browser, all session cookies are deleted automatically.
    * Persistent cookies are deleted after a time period that depends on the relevant cookie and that goes beyond the session, but no later than two months after the cookie is set. You can delete these cookies yourself at any time in the security settings of your browser.
    * In your individual browser settings, you can adjust the use of cookies individually or disallow them entirely. In particular, you can entirely disallow use of third-party cookies. However, in this case, you may not be able to use all the functions of the Internet applications of Edkon Games.

    * If you register a user account, we strongly recommend that you take note of the privacy statement of your app store operator, since Edkon Games no longer has any influence on the processing of the data once they are shared with the operator.
    * The data you transfer are used especially for bilateral contract fulfilment. For this purpose, your data are also passed on to the partners necessary for contract fulfilment. In particular, these include the credit institutes and payment method providers you select.
    * Beyond use for bilateral contract fulfilment, Edkon Games also uses your data for the purpose of marketing and advertising its own services. However, without your separate permission, for example by ordering the Edkon Games newsletter, you only receive information on products and services of Edkon Games that are similar to the products and services you have used.

    * Edkon Games does not have complete knowledge of the nature and scope of the collection of the data, nor can it influence their use and processing.
    * If you enable a plug-in, the plug-in provider is notified that you have enabled the corresponding sub-page of the respective Internet application.
