This Privacy Policy governs your use of the web sites published and

maintained by Electronic Soul ("Electronic Soul," "we," "us," or "our,").

By visiting this Web Site, and/or using the services offered on or

through this Web Site, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy as

they may be amended from time to time. As we update and expand our Web

Site, this Privacy Policy may change. Kff Game encourages you to review

this page from time to time. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into,

and made part of, the Kff Game Web Site Terms of Use, which governs your

use of this Web Site in general.

Summary

It is Electronic Soul¡¯ policy to respect and protect the privacy of

visitors to this Web Site. Accordingly, Electronic Soul does not extract,

without permission, Personal Information (as defined below) about its

visitors or their computer at any time while on Electronic Soul¡¯ Web

Site, except for Personal Information that is actively provided by such

visitors through registration, logging in and out, online forms or other

means. Electronic Soul will, however, analyze information about our

visitors as a group to make our Web Site better, but visitors are not

individually identified when we do this.

When dealing with children who we have actual knowledge are under the age

of 13, Electronic Soul follows stringent guidelines that prohibit the

sharing of Personal Information with any third parties, except in limited

circumstances such as our service providers who use such information on

our behalf. Our privacy policies regarding children are outlined in Kff

Game¡¯ Parental Consent Policy section below.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to information that you may provide to

us, or that we may obtain, through sources other than our Web Site, such

as by phone, mail and other live and print mediums.

This Privacy Policy shall be interpreted under the laws of the United

States, regardless of the location of individual users.

You have the right to opt out of certain uses and disclosures of your

Personal Information. See the Right to Opt Out section below for further

details.

California Privacy Rights

The following applies to California residents who have an established

business relationship with Kff Game. If we collect Personal Information

from you we will not share your Personal Information with any third

parties unless required to do so by operation of law or in order to

prevent harm to you or any other users of our Web Site. For more

information on how your Personal Information is collected, used and

shared, please read the remainder of this Privacy Policy.

What Electronic Soul Collects

Electronic Soul may collect a variety of statistical data about its Web

Site visitors. This data includes the source IP address (as further

described below in the "IP Address and Clickstream Data" section) of the

visitor, the time of visit, the areas of the site visited and information

about browser, operating system and other system parameters. As of the

date of this Privacy Policy, none of this information is used to

personally identify any individual visitor, and is used solely for the

purposes of analyzing overall traffic and usage patterns. However, Kff

Game reserves the right to begin matching such usage data with an

individual¡¯s Personal Information subsequent to the date of this Privacy

Policy.

In order to make your visits to our Web Site and use of the services

available on or through our Web Site as worthwhile as possible, Kff Game

may also collect Personal Information about its visitors, but only when a

visitor provides such Personal Information to us in the process of

entering contests or sweepstakes, signing up for our newsletter(s), using

our "Feedback" feature, registering with the Web Site or using other

services available on or through our Web Site. The information that you

give us and information about your order, purchases or other activities

on the Web Site may be combined with other Personal Information (such as

demographic information and past purchase history) available from our

records and other sources. "Personal Information" includes usernames, e-

mail addresses, wireless addresses, credit card and other payment

information, purchase history, demographic information, and/or other

information that may identify you as an individual or allow online or

offline contact with you as an individual. This information is used by

Electronic Soul to fulfill your requests and for marketing and research

purposes. This information will not be shared with other marketers to

bring you offers of interest. Certain areas of Kff Game¡¯ Web Site may

require user registration in order to gain access; once you register with

the Kff Game Web Site to use that content, you will no longer be

anonymous to us.

Right to Opt Out

You have the right to opt out of certain of our uses of your Personal

Information. For example, at the time you are requested to provide

Personal Information on this Web Site, you may have the opportunity to

elect to, or not to receive correspondence from us. You may make this

request by sending an e-mail to contactus@kffgame.com or by electing to

not receive our e-mail newsletter notifications during your registration

process. Furthermore, all of our correspondence will include a link to

Opt Out of future newsletters and/or notifications. In this e-mail,

please say whether: (i) you would like to opt out of receiving

promotional correspondence from Kff Game in general, or just via e-mail,

postal mail, short message service (SMS), instant messaging, and/or by

phone, and/or (ii) you would only like to opt out of certain of Kff

Game¡¯ e-newsletters or correspondence, and if so which ones. You may

also opt out of Kff Game¡¯ promotional e-mails by clicking on an opt-out

link within the e-mail you receive.

Please understand that if you opt out of receiving correspondence from

us, we may still contact you in connection with your relationship,

activities, transactions and communications with us.

Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies

Electronic Soul may use "cookie" technology to enhance a visitor's online

experience by making it easier to navigate through our Web Site or to

make an activity work better.

Cookies are small pieces of information or data files that are sent

through your browser or related software from a Web server and are stored

on your computer¡¯s hard drive. Cookies may be used to track where you

travel on our Web Site and what you look at and purchase, and they allow

a computer to "remember" information from our Web Site for future use.

The use of cookies is an industry standard and is practiced by most major

Web sites. Cookies alone tell us nothing about who you are, but they may

enable us to relate your use of our Web Site to other information,

including your Personal Information, which you have provided to us when

you registered for notification about one of our products or purchased a

product from us by visiting our Web Site. All of these purposes serve to

enhance your experience while using our services in the ways described

below.

Most Web browsers can be set to inform you when a cookie has been sent to

you and provide you with the opportunity to refuse that cookie.

Additionally, if you have a Flash player installed on your computer, your

Flash player can be set to reject or delete Flash cookies. However,

refusing a cookie may, in some cases, preclude you from using, or

negatively impact the display or function of, the Web Site or certain

areas or features of the Web Site.

Electronic Soul also may use "clear GIFs" (aka "Web beacons" or "pixel

tags") or similar technologies, in the Web Site and/or in our

communications with you to enable us to know whether you have visited a

web page or received a message. A clear GIF is typically a one-pixel,

transparent image (although it can be a visible image as well), located

on a web page or in an e-mail or other type of message, which is

retrieved from a remote site on the Internet enabling the verification of

an individual¡¯s viewing or receipt of a web page or message. A clear gif

may enable us to relate your viewing or receipt of a web page or message

to other information about you, including your Personal Information.

We may use cookies and other tracking technologies in a variety of ways,

including:

Keeping count of return visits to our Web Site or our advertisers¡¯ or

partners¡¯ sites

Accumulating and reporting anonymous, aggregate (data collected in mass),

statistical information on website and advertisement usage

Determining which features our customers like best

IP Address and ¡°Clickstream¡± Data

Our server automatically collects data about your server¡¯s Internet

address when you visit us. This information, known as an Internet

Protocol address, or IP Address, is a number that¡¯s automatically

assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider whenever

you¡¯re on the Internet. When you request pages from our Web Site, our

servers may log your IP Address and sometimes your domain name. Our

server may also record the referring page that linked you to us (e.g.,

another Web site or a search engine); the pages you visit on this Web

Site; the Web site you visit after this Web Site; the ads you see and/or

click on; other information about the type of Web browser, computer,

platform, related software and settings you are using; any search terms

you have entered on this Web Site or a referral site; and other Web usage

activity and data logged by our Web servers. We use this information for

internal system administration, to help diagnose problems with our

server, and to administer our Web Site. Such information may also be used

to gather broad demographic information, such as country of origin and

Internet Service Provider. We reserve the right to link this information

with your Personal Information.

Any or all of these activities with regard to Web site usage information

(i.e., information gathered through the use of cookies, Web bugs and

clickstream data) may be performed on our behalf by our services

providers.

How Electronic Soul Uses Personal Information

Personal Information is used to enhance and custom-tailor each user's

experience on the Web Site. Such information will also be used, for

example, to process your orders, respond to your requests and inquiries

and provide you with the services and features offered on or through our

Web Site.

Electronic Soul may also use Personal Information to maintain our

internal record keeping. We reserve the right to match information

collected from you through different means or at different times,

including both Personal Information and Web Site usage information, and

use such information along with information obtained from other sources.

In addition, we may send you notices (for example, in the form of e-

mails, mailings, and the like), and otherwise correspond with you, about

products, services, companies and events, sponsored by us and others,

that we think might interest you. You may opt-out of receiving such

notices from us by following the instructions in the Right to Opt Out

section above.

In addition, Electronic Soul may use Personal Information to generate

aggregate data about our Web Site¡¯s visitors.

Requests For Feedback

Electronic Soul may request feedback from visitors to the Web Site

regarding an activity or piece of content on the Web Site. Such feedback

is used for internal purposes only.

How Electronic Soul Shares Information Collected Online

Electronic Soul will not sell, rent or give a visitor's Personal

Information to any third party unless required to do so by operation of

the law or in order to protect the users of the Web Site or in the

limited circumstances required in order to correct an error regarding a

players account; in such case, Kff Game will only share as much

information as is necessary and only with its parent or affiliated

partners in order to remedy any errors. Notwithstanding the above, Kff

Game may, however, share aggregate information about users of our Web

Site, such as overall patterns or demographic reports that do not

describe or identify any individual user, with our advertisers, business

partners, sponsors and certain others, as further described herein. As

mentioned above, this aggregate information is used to develop, improve

and customize Kff Game¡¯ Web Site to better serve visitors to our Web

Site.

.

Co-sponsored Contests, Sweepstakes and Offerings

Some of our contests, sweepstakes and other offerings may be co-sponsored

by another company. In those situations, we may share the information we

obtain from you in connection with such contest, sweepstake or offering

with our co-sponsor, unless you instruct us not to by following the

instructions in the Right to Opt Out section above. In those situations,

our co-sponsors will have the right to use your information for their own

purposes, in accordance with their own policies. We are not responsible

for how our co-sponsors may use your information.

Service Providers

We may use third party partners to help operate our Web Site and deliver

our products and services, and may share your information with our

affiliates, service providers and other third parties that provide

products or services for or through this Web Site or for our business

(such as Web site or database hosting companies, address list hosting

companies, e-mail service providers, analytics companies, distribution

companies, fulfillment companies, and other similar service providers

that use such information on our behalf).

Legally Compelled Disclosures

We may disclose user information to government authorities, and to other

third parties when compelled to do so by government authorities, at our

discretion, or otherwise as required or permitted by law, including but

not limited to in response to court orders and subpoenas. We also may

disclose user information when we have reason to believe that someone is

causing injury to or interference with our rights or property, other

users of the Web Site, or anyone else that could be harmed by such

activities. We may also report information about your account to credit

bureaus. Late payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your

account may be reflected in your credit report.

Business Transfer

In the event that Electronic Soul, or substantially all of its assets, is

acquired by one or more third parties as a result of an acquisition,

merger, sale, reorganization, consolidation or liquidation, Personal

Information may be one of the transferred assets.

Wireless Addresses

If the e-mail address you provide to us is a wireless e-mail address, you

agree to receive messages at such address from Electronic Soul. You

understand that your wireless carrier's standard or premium rates apply

to these messages, and that you may change your mind at any time by

following the instructions in the Right to Opt Out section above. You

represent that you are the owner or authorized user of the wireless

device on which messages will be received, and that you are authorized to

approve the applicable charges.

Advertisers and Third Party "Linked-To" Web Sites

Electronic Soul may include advertisements and/or links to web sites

operated by third parties that are not sponsors and are not affiliated

with Electronic Soul. Electronic Soul tries to make sure that when there

are links off the Web Site, they are working and lead visitors to

interesting, fun and informative areas. However, it is hard to guarantee

what exactly is presented on other Web sites or where links elsewhere may

lead. Electronic Soul is not responsible for the content, practices, or

information provided or requested on Web sites operated by third parties.

Further, advertisements on and links to or from kffgame.com do not

constitute sponsorship, endorsement, or approval by Electronic Soul of

the content, policies, practices or products or services offered on these

Web sites.

Parents/guardians should check each Web site's privacy policy and terms

of use in order to understand their policies and practices regarding the

collection and use of personally identifiable information. Kff Game also

suggests that parents/guardians review the privacy policies of all Web

sites that their children visit, including those Web sites linking to or

from the Kff Game Web Site. Information provided to those web sites will

be subject to the privacy policy posted at that web site.

Security

The importance of security for all Personal Information associated with

visitors to our Web Site is of utmost concern to us. Kff Game exercises

great care and implements a variety of technologies in an effort to help

make the Kff Game Web Site secure against unauthorized access and to

protect the Personal Information visitors choose to provide to us. Kff

Game periodically reviews and updates these measures. Unfortunately, due

to the inherent nature of the Internet as an open global communications

vehicle, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be

secure, and Kff Game cannot guarantee that information, during

transmission through the Internet or while stored on our system or

otherwise in our care, will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others,

such as hackers. As a result, while Kff Game strives to protect a

visitor's Personal Information, Kff Game cannot ensure or warrant the

security of any information transmitted to us or from our online products

or services, and a visitor does so at his/her own risk. Electronic Soul

uses the industry standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption when

credit card information is transmitted to us.

If you contact us by e-mail or a "contact us" or similar feature on our

Web site, you should be aware that your transmission might not be secure.

A third party could view information you send by these methods in

transit.

We will have no liability for disclosure of your information due to

errors or unauthorized acts of third parties during or after

transmission.

In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your Personal

Information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we

may seek to notify you of that development. If a notification is

appropriate, we would endeavor to do so as promptly as possible under the

circumstances, and, to the extent we have your e-mail address, we may

notify you by e-mail. You consent to our use of e-mail as a means of such

notification. If you prefer for us to use another method to notify you in

this situation, please e-mail us at contactus@kffgame.com with the

alternative contact information you wish to be used.

Review and deletion of personal information

You may review and delete the Personal Information about you that is

contained in your user account at Electronic Soul at any time. If you

would like to review or delete this information, please contact us at:

Phishing

With identity theft a continuing problem, it has become increasingly

common for unauthorized individuals to send e-mail messages to consumers,

purporting to represent a legitimate company such as a bank or on-line

merchant, requesting that the consumer provide personal, often sensitive

information. Sometimes, the domain name of the e-mail address from which

the e-mail appears to have been sent, and the domain name of the web site

requesting such information, appears to be the domain name of a

legitimate, trusted company. In reality, such sensitive information is

received by an unauthorized individual to be used for purposes of

identity theft. This illegal activity has come to be known as "phishing."

If you receive an e-mail or other correspondence requesting that you

provide any sensitive information (including your Web Site password or

credit card information) via e-mail or to a Web site that does not seem

to be affiliated with our Web Site, or that otherwise seems suspicious to

you, please do not provide such information, and report such request to

us at contactus@electronicsoul.com.

Consent to Processing

By providing Personal Information to this Web Site, you understand and

consent to the collection, maintenance, processing and transfer of such

information in and to the United States and other countries and

territories.

Changes to this Privacy Policy

Electronic Soul Enterprise LTD reserves the right to change or update

this Privacy Policy, or any other of our policies or practices, at any

time, and will notify users of this Web Site by posting such changed or

updated Privacy Policy on this page. Any changes or updates will be

effective immediately upon posting to this Web Site. Under certain

circumstances, we may also elect to notify you of changes or updates to

our Privacy Policy by additional means, such as posting a notice on the

front page of our Web Site to sending you an e-mail.

Business & Legal Affairs

Suite 13

First Floor, Oliaji Trade Centre Francis Rachel Street, Victoria, Mahe,

Republic of Seychelles

Children¡¯s Online Privacy Protection Act

Never provide any information about yourself on the Internet without your

parent's/guardian's permission. Please read Electronic Soul¡¯ Parental

Consent Policy (see below) with your parents/guardians before you go any

further. Where legally required, Kff Game requires your

parent¡¯s/guardian¡¯s written (or electronic) permission for children who

we have actual knowledge are under age thirteen (13) to provide us with

certain Personal Information required to get any Kff Game newsletter(s),

order subscriptions, enter any clubs, etc., or participate in other

activities and/or services available on or through the Web Site.

Electronic Soul¡¯ PARENTAL CONSENT POLICY

Where Electronic Soul¡¯ information collection activities involve

children that Electronic Soul has actual knowledge are under the age of

thirteen (13), Electronic Soul provides special privacy protections. In

accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"),

Electronic Soul will not knowingly collect any Personal Information from

children under the age of thirteen (13) without first obtaining parental

consent or otherwise following the requirements set forth by COPPA.

Furthermore, Electronic Soul does not share any Personal Information that

Kff Game has actual knowledge is about users under the age of thirteen

(13) with third parties.

Prior to providing any Personal Information (such as your name, e-mail

address, address, phone number etc.) either by placing an order for

merchandise, entering a contest or sweepstakes (if eligible), or

participating in any other activity offered through the Web Site, where

legally required, children who Electronic Soul has actual knowledge are

under the age of thirteen (13) must have a parent provide an express

confirmation of parental consent by sending an e-mail to

contactus@kffgame.com. In these instances, users who Electronic Soul has

actual knowledge are under the age of thirteen (13) are prompted for a

parent's e-mail address. This e-mail address will be sent a notification

message with an embedded link to a parental consent page on the Kff Game

Web Site. The child's registration, order, transaction or request will be

considered incomplete until the child's parent uses this link to complete

the parental consent process.

Alternatively, parents may send a written Parental Consent letter to:

Kff Game Enterprise LTD.

Parental Consent

Suite 13

First Floor, Oliaji Trade Centre Francis Rachel Street, Victoria, Mahe,

Republic of Seychelles

The Consent letter must state that the child's "Parent" or "Legal

Guardian," by his or her signature, consents to the collection of the

child's Personal Information. Consent may be revoked by sending a

Parental Consent Revocation letter and sending it to the address or fax

number above. Please note that if a parent does not permit Kff Game¡¯ use

or collection of Personal Information or has instructed Electronic Soul

to delete personally identifiable information, a child's participation in

those Web Site activities for which the Personal Information has been

requested may not be possible.

In compliance with COPPA, Electronic Soul is sensitive about children

consulting with parents or guardians before furnishing Personal

Information or ordering anything online. Electronic Soul encourages

parents/guardians to supervise and join their children in exploring

cyberspace.

With the limited exceptions described in this Privacy Policy, Electronic

Soul will not disclose Personal Information collected from children that

we have actual knowledge are under the age of thirteen (13) to third

parties, except in special cases where Electronic Soul has reason to

believe that disclosure is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal

action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference

(whether intentionally or unintentionally) with Electronic Soul¡¯ rights

or property or anyone else who may be harmed by such actions, or if

required by law.

Electronic Soul recommends that parents/guardians monitor and supervise

the online activities of their children and to consider using available

parental control tools which can prevent children from disclosing their

name, address, and other Personal Information without parental

permission. Visitors to the Web Site who are under thirteen (13) years

old should not be submitting any Personal Information, such as their

name, address, e-mail address, phone number, etc. without a parent's or
