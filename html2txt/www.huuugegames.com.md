interests or those of another person (for example, another player). If we ask
you to provide data to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a
contract with you, this will normally be clear from the context in which we
are asking you to provide your data (for example, when we ask you to provide a
username to access our Services, this will be to create an account for you in
accordance with our Terms of Use), and, if not, we will provide an explanation
to you at the relevant time. We will also make clear whether providing data is
mandatory.

Similarly, if we collect and use your data in reliance on our legitimate
interests (or those of any third party), it will be made clear to you at the
relevant time what those legitimate interests are (such as personalizing our
services and direct marketing, for example).

which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us at any
time.

outside of the European Countries. The data we hold may also be processed by
employees operating outside of the European Countries who work for us, one of
our Affiliated Entities, or one of our business partners or service providers.
This staff may be engaged in, among other things, marketing communication with
players and product development. When we transfer your personal data
internationally we will take reasonable steps to ensure that your data is
treated securely, lawfully, and in the manner we describe here. Please note
that laws vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, so the privacy laws
applicable to the places where your data is transferred to or stored, used, or
processed in, may be different from the privacy laws applicable to the place
where you are resident.

Additionally, if we share with entities which are not subject to the Privacy
Shield framework, and we make sure that these entities ensure an adequate
level of protection, the transfer is supported by the European Commission’s
standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data to a country
outside the European Countries. These standard contractual clauses are
available here: http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-
transfers/transfer/.

Participating European countries’ residents should direct any questions,
concerns or complaints regarding Huuuge’s handling of personal data or
compliance with the Privacy Shield to Huuuge at:
