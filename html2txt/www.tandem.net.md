pressed for time, here are the key points:

  * **We don’t monitor, record or store the contents of your audio or video chat.** We do store messages, message information like timestamps and your Topics, but these will not be shared with any third parties unless required by law.
  * **You can download, edit or permanently delete your personal data at any time.** Your personal data is accessed through the “My Profile” tab.
  * **We keep your data on secured and restricted database servers.** We do everything we can to keep your data secure and encrypted between your device and our servers. Tandem is a global community and we may store data on servers outside your home country. Please note that encryption is not supported in China.
  * **We reserve the right to restrict access to Tandem in the event of misconduct.** Providing a safe and friendly community for language learners is our top priority. We therefore take reports of abuse very seriously. Reports of misconduct on Tandem are reviewed by human moderators and can lead to a ban from our app. Please note that you can choose to share messages with our moderators only as part of the reporting process.

Unless otherwise specified, we obtain the data from you (including via devices
used by you).

##### Data Transfer to Third Countries

Tandem is a worldwide service. Data is transferred to third countries outside
your home country and outside the European Union. This is done on the basis of
contractual regulations stipulated by law that ensure appropriate protection
of your data and that are available for you to view on request.

##### Retention Period

We retain your data:

  * If you have consented to this as part of processing, until such time as you withdraw your consent (e.g. by deleting your account);
  * If we need the data to fulfil an agreement, until such time as the contractual relationship with you ceases or legal retention periods expire;
  * If we use the data on the basis of a legitimate interest, until such time as your overriding interest obliges us to delete or anonymize them.

##### Purposes of Use

Personal data will only be collected by us to the extent and for the purpose
for which you provide the data to us, e.g. for registering an account.

We use and store your personal data as part of our services for the following
purposes and only if you have provided us with your express consent:

  * To create a public user profile for you on Tandem;
  * To provide a curated community just for language learners, where access is restricted to members only. We take best efforts to prevent abuse and ban offenders, as soon as we are made aware;
  * To send information relevant to the service, e.g. via email or push notification (e.g. updates on your membership status, missed calls/messages, new followers);
  * To target ads in the app (this can be turned off in settings);
  * To find Tandem partners nearby;
  * To understand how Tandem is used and optimize the service
  * We use your personal information only within the company and forward it only to those companies that are involved in performing the contracts concluded with you or otherwise involved in providing the relevant service.

Otherwise, your personal information will not be forwarded to third parties
unless you have given your express consent for this or unless we are obliged
to disclose it – for example, at the direction of a court or administrative
authority.

We forward the following customer data to third parties:

  * To analyze how Tandem is used by our members and optimize the service and design, anonymous usage and personal data is shared with Google Analytics, Firebase Analytics, New Relic, Facebook Analytics and Rubylight Limited.

  * To communicate information relevant to the service via email or push notification, names, device IDs, email addresses and other personal information may be shared with OneSignal (https://onesignal.com) and Sparkpost (https://sparkpost.com). You can control what type of messages you receive in the profile settings, switch off push notifications for Tandem completely in your device settings and unsubscribe from email notifications in each individual email.

  * To make ads more personal, we may share personal but anonymized information, such as age and gender as well as device identifiers with MoPub, InMobi, MyTarget, Admob by Google, Facebook Audience Network, Ad Xchange and Fyber. iOS and Android devices have a resettable advertising identifier that companies can use to target ads based on the apps you use.

  * Both iOS and Android devices allow you to opt out of the use of mobile advertising identifiers for purposes of showing you targeted ads. For iOS, go to your iOS device settings and turn on the “limit ad tracking” setting. For Android, turn on “opt out of ads personalization” in your Android device settings.

  * We create Tandem member profiles based on your login data and also use these profiles and the information they contain, provided by you, for the following purposes:

  * We create a public member profile for you on Tandem so that members can find the most relevant language exchange partners to communicate with. While some elements of your profile, including your first name, age, profile picture, language settings, profile answers, current city, time zone and Topics are public, only verified community members can contact you via the Tandem app. We never show your email address, exact location, last name or any information you have chosen not to share in your profile settings to other members.

  * We store applications for membership in the community, including your personal data for a minimum of seven days. After that period, you can permanently delete all personal data from Tandem using the “Delete My Application” button in the app.

  * In order to keep Tandem a safe place for language learners, we take violations of our community rules very seriously. Therefore, we retain anonymous personal identities of banned users for 18 months and might prevent access to the community on this basis during this period.

To control target group-related advertising, we record information about
activities on our apps and websites (e.g. advertising banners clicked, screens
viewed, and pages visited, etc.) This is recorded under a pseudonym and we may
use this to provide our customers’ users with advertising targeted to their
interests.

For this purpose, a cookie may be stored on your device. Cookies are small
text files that are stored on your computer’s hard drive. They enable
recognition of your computer but do not permit you to be personally
identified.

If you do not want cookies to be installed, you can opt out using your browser
settings. On mobile devices you can opt out of sharing advertising
identifiers.

If you do not want personal information to be shared with ad networks, you can
opt out in the My Profile section of the Tandem app.

You can edit, hide and delete personal data in the My Profile settings within
the Tandem app. Also, you can request the deletion of your account or ask for
certain profile information to be changed via Tandem’s customer support
(support@tandem.net).

##### Data Protection

We have taken extensive technical and organizational measures to secure your
data against potential risks, such as unauthorized login or access,
unauthorized perusal, amendment or distribution, and against loss, deletion or
misuse.

In order to protect your personal data against unauthorized access by third
parties when being transmitted, we secure data transmissions, if necessary,
using SSL and TLS encryption. This is a standard encryption procedure for
online and mobile services, particularly for the Internet. Encryption is not
supported in China.

Regarding video and audio chats: we will not monitor, record or broadcast
video and audio chat sessions at any time. However, we cannot prevent your
chat partners from broadcasting live or recorded chat sessions without your or
our permission through third party websites or services. We recommend that you
exercise caution in disclosing any information, personal or otherwise, during
a video or chat session.
