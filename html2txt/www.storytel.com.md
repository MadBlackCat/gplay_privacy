Storytel cooperates with third party payment service providers who operate
independently in systems separated from Storytel, no complete payment data,
such as complete credit card numbers, will be stored by Storytel. Storytel
encourages You to inform yourself of such third party payment providers'
privacy practices.

### 5.For how long is the Data kept?

5.1.

Storytel will keep Your personal data only as long as it is necessary with
regard to the purpose of the respective processing activity.

5.2.

This means that personal data collected and processed for marketing purposes
will be stored for as long as You are a Subscriber and for twelve (12) months
after Your subscription has ended unless You have given Storytel Your consent
to continue to process such data.

5.3.

In order to fulfill our contractual obligations, monitor and document usage of
Gift Cards and Free Trial periods and other add-on services, we will store the
personal data You have provided at sign up (such as Your name and/or user
name, e-mail address and/or phone number and payment details) as long as You
are a Subscriber, Gift Card user or Free Trial user and for a period of
twenty-four (24) months after Your subscription, Your purchase of a Gift Card,
or Your use of Gift Card or Free Trial has ended whichever is the latest.

5.4.

We will keep Your personal Storytel audiobook/ebook library information as
long as You are a Subscriber and for a period of twenty-four (24) months
thereafter in order to facilitate and improve Your experience, should You wish
to return as a Subscriber within the aforementioned time period.

5.5.

When You contact Storytel to receive support or for other purposes we will
store Your personal data for twenty-four (24) months after resolving Your
latest support ticket (e.g. issues and requests).

5.6.

Your Personal data is processed for analytical purposes during Your
subscription period and for twenty-four (24) months thereafter.

5.7.

Storytel may store personal data for a longer time than the aforementioned
times if required by law or in order to establish, exercise or defend a right
in a legal claim.

5.8.

Storytel will cease to retain personal data, or remove the means by which the
data can be associated with You, as soon as it is reasonable to assume that
retention no longer serves the purpose for which the personal data was
collected and is no longer necessary for legal or business purposes.

### 6.Where is the personal Data stored?

6.1.

Your personal data is stored on servers located in the country where the
Contracting Party (as defined in the Terms of use) is established. Personal
data is also stored in Sweden, where Storytel's main establishment is located.
For international transfers, Storytel applies security measures as described
below in 10.5.

### 7.Why does Storytel process your personal data?

7.1.

Storytel processes Your personal data for various purposes. Primarily,
Storytel processes Your personal data in order to manage the customer
relationship with You and to fulfill its legal obligations. Your personal data
may also be processed for market and customer analysis, market research,
statistics, business monitoring and business and methodological development
for Storytel in order to develop and customize the Service and its features.

7.2.

Storytel also processes Your personal data to provide better and more
personalized offers and services. Storytel also processes Your personal data
to decrease the risk of sending You irrelevant advertising or other types of
irrelevant marketing . Personal data may, for example, be processed, linked,
segmented and analyzed in order, by means of targeted marketing via for
instance email, in app push notifications and advertising on third party
channels, to provide information, offers or recommendations on Storytel’s or
its partners’ goods and services, which are tailored to Your preferences,
behavior, needs or lifestyle. It may also be used as a basis for targeted
marketing towards audiences that are similar to Storytel’s existing users.
This may e.g. include processing of personal data for the purpose of creating
custom audiences on third party platforms such as Facebook and Google.
Storytel may also analyze and combine the information about You to which
Storytel has access via the Service from Your online visits or other records
(e.g. Facebook or other similar social media providers) for purposes specified
in this section.

7.3.

In addition to the above, Storytel processes Your personal data to prevent,
detect and investigate potential prohibited or illegal activities, including
fraud, and to enforce our Terms (e.g. determining whether You are eligible for
a Free Trial period or for any other offer or marketing campaign as the case
may be).

### 8.What is the legal basis for the processing?

8.1.

A majority of the personal data that Storytel processes about You are
processed because it is necessary for Storytel’s performance of the Terms,
i.e. in order for Storytel to be able to provide and administer the Service
and its features. Such is the case when Storytel processes e.g. Your contact
details such as Your e-mail address or Your phone number and information from
the payment service provider.

8.2.

Some of the personal data which Storytel processes are processed based on a
balance of interest, i.e. Storytel’s legitimate interest of processing the
data outweighs the impact and risk the processing may have on Your integrity.
Such is the case when Storytel processes Your personal data for support
purposes (e.g. general support requests) or certain marketing purposes other
than for direct marketing and when we store Your Storytel audio/ebook
(including other literary content) library information after Your subscription
has ended.

8.3.

Additionally, some personal data is processed based on Your consent. This is
the case for the processing of such personal data that Storytel gets access to
via Your Facebook account, for direct marketing of Storytel’s or Storytel’s
partners’ goods and services. If You provide personal data of other natural
persons, such as Your family members, You are responsible for seeing to that
they consent to the processing of their personal data.

8.4.

To the extent that processing is carried out with consent as a sole legal
basis, it is voluntary for You to give such a consent and You may at any time,
wholly or partly, withdraw Your consent.

### 9.Data security and Integrity

9.1.

The security, integrity and confidentiality of Your personal data is very
important to us. We have implemented technical, administrative and physical
security measures that are designed to protect Your personal data from in
particular unauthorized access or disclosure, use, modification, destruction
and loss. From time to time, we review our security procedures in order to
assess the need to implement additional measures or to make technical upgrades
to existing procedures. Please be aware that, despite our best efforts, few
security measures are impenetrable, and we therefore kindly ask that You
inform us immediately of any suspicious activities that You notice in the
Service.

### 10.Who does Storytel disclose your personal data to?

10.1.

Storytel may disclose Your personal data to its affiliates, i.e. to companies
within the Storytel group, business partners, suppliers and other third
parties in order to fulfil the agreement with You or to fulfil agreements with
Storytel’s suppliers and business partners or otherwise according to the
purposes set out in this privacy policy. This might be the case when we
provide information to e.g. Your bank to prove compliance and sort out
misunderstandings etc.

10.2.

Storytel may also disclose Your personal data to third parties for the purpose
of sending You tailored advertising and marketing, for the purpose of avoiding
to send You irrelevant advertising or other types of irrelevant marketing, to
measure the success and outreach of our digital marketing and for other
promotional purposes. Such is the case when Storytel uses remarketing features
and impression, interest and demographic reporting in Google Analytics,
uploads custom audiences to e.g. Facebook and Google and when we inform our
business partners, such as Facebook and Google, that a certain marketing
measure generated a new specific customer or a number of new customers as the
case may be.

10.3.

Storytel may also disclose personal data to companies that process personal
data on our behalf, such as our IT system providers, customer service
companies and affiliates. If personal data is disclosed to such companies that
process data on Storytel’s behalf, Storytel enters into data processing
agreements with such parties in order to ensure that a high level of security
for Your personal data is maintained.

10.4.

Personal data may also be disclosed, if needed, to comply with statutory legal
requirements or requirements from authorities or agencies, to safeguard
Storytel’s legal interests or to detect, prevent, or pay attention to fraud
and other security or technical issues.

10.5.

As an international business, we may store Your personal data in the European
Union (EU) or in the European Economic Area (EEA) or in other locations. When
Your personal data is transferred between different countries, the transfer is
made to the previously described categories of recipients and for the purposes
set out in this privacy policy.

As previously mentioned, Your personal data is transferred to the previously
described categories of recipients for the purposes set out in this privacy
policy. We will take steps to ensure that Your personal data continues to
receive a standard of protection that is at least comparable to that provided
under the Personal Data Protection Act in Singapore.

### 11.Links to external websites

11.1.

Information provided by Storytel may contain links to websites operated or
owned by someone other than Storytel. Storytel is not responsible for the
processing of personal data carried out on these websites. Storytel encourages
You to inform yourself of the privacy practices of the respective website
controllers.

### 12.Changes to the Privacy Policy

12.1.

This privacy policy may be revised from time to time. If Storytel makes any
significant changes to the privacy policy, Storytel will inform You by e-mail,
SMS or through the Service before the changes take effect. The most recent
version of our privacy policy will also be published on Storytel’s website. If
any change requires Your consent, Storytel will make a request for such new
consent from You. We encourage You to review this privacy policy frequently in
order to stay informed about our data processing practices.

### 13.Your rights under EU/EEA Law

13.1.

If You are located in the EU/EEA, or if Your personal data is otherwise being
processed by a Storytel entity within the EU/EEA, You have the following
rights (in addition to withdraw Your consent):

Right of access: You have a right to ask whether or not we have personal data
about You and, if that is the case, request information on what personal data
we have about You and why and how we process it.

Right to rectification: We are required to rectify inaccurate personal data,
or to complete personal data that is incomplete, on request.

Right to erasure (right to be forgotten): We are in some circumstances
required to erase Your personal data on Your request.

Right to data portability: Under certain circumstances, You may have the right
to receive their personal data to which we have access, in a structured,
commonly used and machine-readable format and with a right to transmit those
data to another entity.

Right to object: In some cases, You may object to our use of Your personal
data. We may then be required to stop using the personal data. One example
when this might apply is when personal data is used for marketing and
profiling purposes.

13.2.

Please note that some of the rights above may only be exercised in certain
situations, e.g. the right to data portability, which only applies when the
processing is carried out on the basis of contractual necessity or consent and
if the processing is carried out by automated means and the right to have data
deleted, which only applies when data is processed based on a balance of
interest or consent.

### 14.General

data, want to exercise any of Your rights or want to know more about the
