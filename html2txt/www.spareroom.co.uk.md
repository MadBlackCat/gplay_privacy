    2. Some cookies we use are necessary for our website to function properly and to enable you to move around the site and use its features. In addition we also use so called "functional" cookies, which allow our website to remember choices you’ve made in relation to the website, so as to provide a more personalised and enhanced user experience. Examples of the functional cookies we use on the site, and the information we collect through the use of those cookies, include those that remember details about your account preferences, including your password and login details, your search history and adverts you have posted to the site, the types of alerts and newsletters you have opted to receive and the types of adverts you are interested in hearing about.

The information generated relating to the website may be used to create reports about the use of the website - the analytics service provider will store this information. Individual users will not be identifiable from this information.
    4. In addition, we are also using the following types of cookies on the site: 

Google AdWords

    Using Google AdWords code, we are able to see which pages helped lead to registering and, where applicable, upgrading. This allows us to make better use of our paid search budget on Google.. You can also choose to opt-out of AdWords remarketing here.
DoubleClick

    We use Google Analytics remarketing codes to log when users view specific pages or take specific actions on the website. This allows us to provide targeted advertising in the future when you browse other websites.
Facebook Pixel

    We use the Facebook Pixel to understand how people we advertise to on Facebook, and Facebook partners, interact with our site. The Facebook Pixel also allows us to identify groups of Facebook users who are similar to groups of SpareRoom users and advertise our services to them. Guidance on how to opt out is available here. 
Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting

    These help us better understand who our users are so we can make content on other channels, such as YouTube, more relevant. You can choose to opt out of these cookies here.
Hotjar

    2. We recommend you don’t turn cookies off when using SpareRoom as this may prevent you from using many of the services on the site. However, please note that if you continue to browse our website you are consenting to our use of cookies in accordance with this privacy policy.
  7. ### Payment information

All payment for any products or services offered through our site, including
for any adverts or Early Bird, access are made via a secure server provided by
our third party payment processors, currently Stripe, WorldPay and Paypal. We
will not collect, store or process any credit card or other payment
information on our own servers. We are a Safe Buy accredited website.

  8. ### Third party content, websites and contributors

    1. Our website may contain content and links to other websites and microsites that are operated by third parties. In addition, advertisements contained on our website may operate as links to that advertiser’s website, and such advertisers and third parties may also use and place cookies on your computer.
    2. We do not control, and accept no liability or responsibility for, these third party websites, advertisements and cookies. This privacy policy does not apply to such third party websites, microsites, advertisements and cookies. Any information such third parties collect by virtue of you clicking on a third party link on our website will be collected and used in accordance with the privacy policy of that third party. Please consult the terms and conditions and privacy policy of those third party websites and microsites to find out how they collect and use your personal data and to establish whether and for what purpose they use cookies.
  9. ### Security and data retention

    1. We employ appropriate technological and operational security measures to protect against any unauthorised access to or unlawful processing of any personal information about you that we hold. We will retain your information for a period as defined in our data retention policy or as long as the law requires or permits.
    2. Data transmission over the internet is inherently insecure. Although we employ appropriate technological and organisational security measures to protect your data we cannot guarantee the security of any data sent over the internet.
  10. ### International data transfers

    1. We collect data from wherever users are situated. The information we collect will be transferred to the UK from any other country in which you may be located, and will as such be subject to General Data Protection Regulation rather than the laws of the country in which you are resident.
    2. We do not transfer personal data collected via our website outside the European Economic Area (unless you have consented; it is necessary to provide the services you have requested; or it is otherwise required or permitted by law).
  11. ### Your rights

    1. You are entitled to know what personal data we hold about you and you may ask us to make any necessary changes to ensure it is accurate and kept up to date. If you wish to do this, please contact us using the contact information provided in section 1 above. There will be no charge for this service; if, however, you log multiple requests, a nominal charge may be applied to cover the administration of those requests. We may also require you to provide us with appropriate identification.
    2. Under the GDPR, you have the right to ‘block’ or request the deletion or removal of personal data to prevent further processing. This right to erasure is also known as ‘the right to be forgotten’. Specific circumstances in which you can request the deletion or removal of personal data include: 
      1. Where the personal data is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise processed
      2. Where you withdraw consent
      3. When you object to the processing and there is no overriding legitimate interest for continuing the processing
      4. Where the personal data was unlawfully processed (i.e. otherwise in breach of the GDPR)
      5. Where the personal data has to be erased in order to comply with a legal obligation

Personal data associated with any account on our site will be retained for a
maximum period of 12 months following an account closure. We reserve the right
to access this data during this period for the purposes of fraud prevention
and/or to investigate any complaints we may receive.

In case a deletion is not possible due to legal, statutory or contractual
retention periods, or if it requires disproportionate efforts or prejudices
your legitimate interests, the data will be blocked instead of deleted.

    3. You may also request from us a copy of any of your personal data that has been processed through automated means. This will be provided in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format (where technically feasible), which you may then transmit to another controller. You have the right to request that we send this data to another controller on your behalf, but only if it is technically feasible to do so.
    4. You have the right to withdraw your consent for us to collect, process and store your data at any time. If you wish to withdraw your consent, please confirm this via email to DPO@nullspareroom.co.uk
    5. If you have a complaint about any aspect of data protection or if you feel your privacy has been breached by us, we would like to hear from you. To help us investigate and resolve your concerns as quickly as possible, please contact us via email to DPO@nullspareroom.co.uk
    6. You may request that we cease sending you any marketing information at any time by notifying us in writing, following any "unsubscribe" instructions included in any marketing communications which we send to you, or by clicking on "My Account" on the website homepage and updating your account preferences.
    7. If you are unhappy with the final response you have received from us, you have the right to complain to the supervisory authority: the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). You can call the ICO on 030 3123 1113 or visit the ICO website: ico.org.uk.
    8. You are required to provide personal data in order to enter into a contract with us. Failure to provide this personal data may mean that we are unable to execute the contract, and could result in termination of our provision of services to you.
    9. If at any time we intend to process your personal data for a reason or in a manner not originally communicated, then prior to performing that processing we will provide you with all relevant information, in accordance with section 11.2 above.
  12. ### Changes to our privacy policy

We reserve the right to make changes to this privacy policy from time to time.
Any such changes to our privacy policy will be posted to our website and, if
we consider it to be appropriate, sent to you by e-mail.
