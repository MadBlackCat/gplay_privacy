the term "Cookies" for cookies and all such similar technologies.

We hope you will want the better service that Cookies allow, but if you
prefer, you can set your browser to refuse Cookies or to inform you every time
a website requests permission to store a Cookie. Previously stored Cookies can

## Social plug-ins

When you encounter an implemented social plug-in (e.g. "like" button) from a
third party, such as Facebook, Twitter or Google, while using our Service,
your browser or App, as applicable, will establish a direct link to that third
party ("Social Plug-in") and will then transmit the following data to the
Social Plug-in directly:

  1. date and time of your visit;
  2. the Internet address/URL of the site that you are currently visiting;
  3. your IP address;
  4. your browser;
  5. your operating system;
  6. your user code if you are a registered user of Social Plug-in and if applicable your surname and first name; and
  7. if you click on the plug-in, of course the information that you have used this specific plug-in.

We explicitly make reference to the fact that we ourselves do not have any
influence on the scope of the data which Social Plug-in collects with the help
of the plug-in and that with regard to data protection we have to rely on the
data usage guideline of Social Plug-in. Please inform yourself further on
Social Plug-in specifically about the purpose and scope of the data collection
and your rights in this regard and the setting options to protect your privacy
using the data usage guidelines.

However, it is of course possible to prevent the placing of cookies by
settings in your browser. In addition, it is also possible to block the social
plug-ins of Social Plug-in with add-ons for your browser.

## Notice of changes

If we make changes to this Privacy Policy we will notify you by publication on
Privacy Policy. If the changes are material, we will provide you additional,
prominent notice as appropriate under the circumstances and, where required
under applicable law, ask for your consent.
