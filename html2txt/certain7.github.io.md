7\. Profiling

鈥淎utomated decision making鈥漴efers to a decision which is taken though the
automated processing of your personal data alone. This means processing using,
for example, software code or an algorithm, which does not involve any human
intervention. As profiling uses automated processing, it is sometimes
connected with automated decision making. Not all profiling results in
automated decision making, but it can do.

If you are a consumer that has signed up to receive marketing updates, we may
use profiling to ensure that marketing materials are tailored to your
preferences and to what we think you will be interested in. This does not have
any significant effect, or a legal effect on you. In certain circumstances it
may be possible to infer certain information about you from the result of
profiling, which may include special categories of data. We will not however
conduct profiling based on your special categories of data unless we have
obtained your explicit consent to do so.

including profiling where that decision has significant effects on you,
including where it produces a legal effect on you. See Section 9.

the purposes listed in Section 3 and relevant Appendixes of this Policy. In
some circumstances we may retain your personal data for longer periods of
time, for example where we are required to do so to meet legal, regulatory,
tax or accounting requirements.

In specific circumstances we may also retain your personal data for longer
periods of time so that we have an accurate record of your dealings with us in
the event of any complaints or challenges, or if we reasonably believe there
is a possibility of legal action relating to your personal data or dealings.
Where your personal data is no longer required we will ensure it is either
securely deleted or stored in a way which means it will no longer be used by
the business.

9\. What are your rights?

You have a number of rights in relation to your personal data. In summary, you
may request access to your data, rectification of any mistakes in our files,
erasure of records where no longer required, restriction on the processing of
your data, objection to the processing of your data, data portability and
various information in relation to any automated decision making and profiling
or the basis for international transfers. You also have the right to complain
to your supervisory authority (further details of which are set out in Section
11 below).

Those underlined are defined in more detail as follows:

_Access_

You can ask us to:

路        confirm whether we are processing your personal data;

路        give you a copy of that data;

路        provide you with other information about your personal data such as
what data we have, what we use it for, who we disclose it to, whether we
transfer it abroad and how we protect it, how long we keep it for, what rights
you have, how you can make a complaint, where we got your data from and
whether we have carried out automated decision making or profiling, to the
extent that information has not already been provided to you in this Policy.

_Rectification_

You can ask us to rectify inaccurate personal data. We may seek to verify the
accuracy of the data before rectifying it.

_Erasure_

You can ask us to erase your personal data, but only where:

路        it is no longer needed for the purposes for which it was collected;
or

路        you have withdrawn your consent (where the data processing was based
on consent); or

路        following a successful right to object (see 鈥渙bjection鈥漛elow); or

路        it has been processed unlawfully; or

路        to comply with a legal obligation which app is subject to.

We are not required to comply with your request to erase your personal data if
the processing of your personal data is necessary: for compliance with a legal
obligation; or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.
There are certain other circumstances in which we are not required to comply
with your erasure request, although these two are the most likely
circumstances where we would deny that request.

_Restriction_

You can ask us to restrict (i.e. keep but not use) your personal data, but
only where:

路        its accuracy is contested (see 鈥渞ectification鈥漛elow), to allow us to
verify its accuracy; or

路        the processing is unlawful, but you do not want it erased; or

路        it is no longer needed for the purposes for which it was collected,
but we still need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or

路        you have exercised the right to object, and verification of
overriding grounds is pending.

We can continue to use your personal data following a request for restriction,
where:

路        we have your consent; or

路        to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or

路        to protect the rights of another natural or legal person.

_Portability_

You can ask us to provide your personal data to you in a structured, commonly
used, machine-readable format, or you can ask to have it 鈥減orted鈥漝irectly to
another data controller, but in each case only where: the processing is based
on your consent or the performance of a contract with you; and the processing
is carried out by automated means.

_Objection_

You can object to any processing of your personal data which has our
legitimate interests as its legal basis (see Section 3 or contact us for
further details), if you believe your fundamental rights and freedoms outweigh
our legitimate interests. Once you have objected, we have an opportunity to
demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate interests which override your
rights.

_Automated Decision Making_

You can ask not to be subject to a decision which is based solely on automated
processing (see Section 8), but only where that decision:

路        produces legal effects concerning you (such as the rejection of a
claim); or

路        otherwise significantly affects you.

In such situations, you can obtain human intervention in the decision making,
and we will ensure measures are in place to allow you to express your point of
view, and / or contest the automated decision. Your right to obtain human
intervention or to contest a decision does not apply where the decision which
is made following automated decision making:

路        is necessary for entering into or performing a contract with you;

路        is authorized by law and there are suitable safeguards for your
rights and freedoms; or

路        is based on your explicit consent.

To exercise your rights you may contact us as set out in Section 11. Please
note the following if you do wish to exercise these rights:

路        Identity. We take the confidentiality of all records containing
personal data seriously, and reserve the right to ask you for proof of your
identity if you make a request.

路        Fees. We will not ask for a fee to exercise any of your rights in
relation to your personal data, unless your request for access to information
is unfounded, repetitive or excessive, in which case we will charge a
reasonable amount in the circumstances. We will let you know of any charges
before completing your request.

路        Timescales. We aim to respond to any valid requests within one month
unless it is particularly complicated or you have made several requests, in
which case we aim to respond within three months. We will let you know if we
are going to take longer than one month. We might ask you if you can help by
telling us what exactly you want to receive or are concerned about. This will
help us to action your request more quickly.

路        Exemptions. Local laws may provide additional exemptions, e.g. in the
UK, where it is subject to legal privilege, the right of access to personal
data can be withheld from you in certain circumstances.

路        Third Party Rights. We do not have to comply with a request where it
would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of other Data Subjects.

10\. How we PROTECT your personal data?

We endeavor to protect us and you from unauthorized access to or unauthorized
alteration, disclosure or destruction of personal data that we hold.

In particular:

路        We review our information collection, storage and processing
practices, including physical security measures, to guard against unauthorized
access to systems;

路        We use encryption where appropriate;

路        We use password protection where appropriate; and

路        We restrict access to personal data to our employees, contractors and
agents who need access to the relevant personal data in order to for them to
process it for us and who are subject to strict contractual confidentiality
obligations.

You are responsible for the personal data that you choose to share, disclose
or submit voluntarily while using our website or devices and which can be
viewed by members of third party applications or sites such as chat
applications or messengers.

When you utilize third-party social media services, email, text messages etc.
which you accessed via using our product, and to interact with other users or
service providers and exchange personal contact, geographic location or track

services have made such information transmission to be fully encrypted. Please
take care to protect the security of your personal data, and especially avoid
sharing sensitive personal data when you鈥檙e uncertain about the security of
data transfer.

Please understand that due to the rapid development of computer and internet
technologies, various measures of attack may exist or be created, whether
vicious or not, which renders no applications or internet transmission to be
100% secure. While we continuously take reasonable technical, administrative,
and physical measures to protect the information you provided, we still may
not be able to guarantee absolute security of your information at all times.
Where the relevant information and data collected is stored on your device,
