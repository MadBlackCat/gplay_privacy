Welcome to the services operated by Twitch Interactive, Inc. (with its

http://www.twitch.tv, and its network of websites, software applications, or
any other products or services offered by Twitch (the “ **Twitch Services**
”). Other services offered by Twitch may be subject to separate terms.

  
When using the Twitch Services, you will be subject to Twitch’s Privacy
Policy, Twitch’s Community Guidelines, and you be subject to additional
guidelines or rules that are posted on the Twitch Services or made available
to you, or applicable to specific services and features that are disclosed to
you in connection with such services. Twitch may also offer certain paid
services, which are subject to the Twitch Terms of Sale as well as any
additional terms or conditions that are disclosed to you in connection with
such services. All such terms and guidelines (the " **Guidelines** ") are
incorporated into these Terms of Service by reference.

The Terms of Service apply whether you are a user that registers an account
with the Twitch Services or an unregistered user. You agree that by clicking
“Sign Up” or otherwise registering, downloading, accessing or using the Twitch
Services, you are entering into a legally binding agreement between you and
Twitch regarding your use of the Twitch Services. You acknowledge that you
have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you
do not agree to these Terms of Service, do not access or otherwise use any of
the Twitch Services.

When using or opening an account with Twitch on behalf of a company, entity,
or organization (collectively, “ **Subscribing Organization** ”), you
represent and warrant that you: (i) are an authorized representative of that
Subscribing Organization with the authority to bind that organization to these
Terms of Service and grant the licenses set forth herein; and (ii) agree to
these Terms of Service on behalf of such Subscribing Organization.

#### 2\. Use of Twitch by Minors and Blocked Persons

The Twitch Services are not available to persons under the age of 13. If you

in your jurisdiction of residence), you may only use the Twitch Services under
the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to be bound by these
Terms of Service.

The Twitch Services are also not available to any users previously removed
from the Twitch Services by Twitch. Finally, the Twitch Services are not
available to any persons barred from receiving them under the laws of the
United States (such as its export and re-export restrictions and regulations)
or applicable laws in any other jurisdiction.

BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, OR OTHERWISE USING THE TWITCH SERVICES, YOU
REPRESENT THAT YOU ARE AT LEAST 13 YEARS OF AGE, THAT YOUR PARENT OR LEGAL
GUARDIAN AGREES TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS OF SERVICE IF YOU ARE BETWEEN 13
AND THE AGE OF LEGAL MAJORITY IN YOUR JURISDICTION OF RESIDENCE, AND THAT YOU
HAVE NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY REMOVED FROM OR PROHIBITED FROM RECEIVING THE TWITCH
SERVICES.

#### 3\. Privacy Policy

Your privacy is important to Twitch. Please see our Privacy Policy for
information relating to how we collect, use, and disclose your personal
information, and Privacy Choices on how you can manage your online privacy
when you use the Twitch Services.

#### 4\. Account

##### a. Account and Password

In order to open an account, you will be asked to provide us with certain
information such as an account name and password.

You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account
and password, for restricting access to your computer, and for all activities
that occur under your account or password. Please make sure the information
you provide to Twitch upon registration and at all other times is true,
accurate, current, and complete to the best of your knowledge.

Unless expressly permitted in writing by Twitch, you may not sell, rent,
lease, share or provide access to your account to anyone else, including
without limitation charging anyone for access to administrative rights on your
account. Twitch reserves all available legal rights and remedies to prevent
unauthorized use of the Twitch Services, including, but not limited to,
technological barriers, IP mapping, and, in serious cases, directly contacting
your Internet Service Provider (ISP) regarding such unauthorized use.

##### b. Third Party Accounts

Twitch may permit you to register for and log on to the Twitch Services via
certain third party services. The third party’s collection, use and disclosure
of your information will be subject to that third party service’s privacy
policy. Further information about how Twitch collects, uses and discloses your
personal information when you link your Twitch account and with your account
on any third party service can be found in our Privacy Policy.

#### 5\. Use of Devices and Services

Access to the Twitch Services may require the use of your personal computer or
mobile device, as well as communications with or use of space on such devices.
You are responsible for any Internet connection or mobile fees and charges
that you incur when accessing the Twitch Services.

#### 6\. Modification of these Terms of Service

Twitch may amend any of the terms of these Terms of Service by posting the
terms. Your continued use of the Twitch Services after the effective date of
the revised Terms of Service constitutes your acceptance of the terms.

If you are a consumer resident in the European Union and you disagree with any
proposed modifications that Twitch has made to the Terms of Service, we
encourage you to contact us as soon as possible after you start using the
Twitch Services at legal@twitch.tv since otherwise they will be binding on you
a reasonable time period after you received notice of the proposed modified
Terms of Service (usually 30 days unless there are exceptional circumstances).

#### 7\. License

indicated, all content, information, and other materials on the Twitch

or the Materials except as specifically authorized in these Terms of Service,
without the prior written permission of Twitch, is strictly prohibited and may
violate intellectual property rights or other laws. Unless explicitly stated
in these Terms of Service, nothing in them shall be interpreted as conferring

or other legal principles. Twitch can terminate this license at any time,
without notice, including where we reasonably consider that: (a) your use of
the Twitch Services violates these Terms of Service or applicable law; (b) you
fraudulently use or misuse the Twitch Services; or (c) we are unable to

business reasons.

sub-licensees are allowed to use them to the extent indicated in these Terms
of Service.

(ii) With respect to User Content known as “add-ons”, “maps”, “mods”, or other
types of projects submitted through CurseForge.com or related sites

remove or delete such Submitted Projects from the Twitch Services. You also
acknowledge that Twitch may retain, but not display, distribute, or perform,

Twitch reserves all rights and remedies against any users who breach these
representations and warranties.

Content against unauthorized copying and distribution. However, Twitch does
not guarantee that any unauthorized copying, use or distribution of User
Content by third parties will not take place. To the furthest extent permitted
by applicable law, you hereby agree that Twitch shall not be liable for any
unauthorized copying, use or distribution of User Content by third parties and
release and forever waive any claims you may have against Twitch for any such
unauthorized copying or usage of the User Content, under any theory. THE
SECURITY MEASURES TO PROTECT USER CONTENT USED BY TWITCH HEREIN ARE PROVIDED
AND USED “AS-IS” AND WITH NO WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, CONDITIONS, ASSURANCES OR

jurisdiction. Whether the dispute is heard in arbitration or in court, you and
Twitch will not commence against the other a class action, class arbitration
or other representative action or proceeding.

#### 17\. Requests for Information and How to Serve a Subpoena

All requests for information or documents related to potential, anticipated or

and its relationship to your investigation. Please also note that limiting

#### 18\. Specific Terms for Twitch Sings

Twitch Sings (“Twitch Sings”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a
free-to-play singing game and streamer tool, available on PC, iOS, and
Android. It allows anyone to sing rights-cleared music privately or live on
their personal Twitch channel, and to create and share VODs with users of
Twitch and other users of Twitch Sings. All game activity can be streamed to
Twitch without any additional software.  
  
Sing a song start to finish, perform a duet, or go live within a concert
setting to hundreds of cheering fans.  Bonus: if you use the Twitch Sings
feature that allows you to live stream your performance to Twitch, emotes from
chat will rise from the audience, while follows, cheers and subscription
notices are highlighted with alerts and in-concert effects.  
  
Before you stage dive on top of screaming fans, several guidelines:

  * Sing the song lyrics as displayed in the app or, when song lyrics are not displayed, to the best of your knowledge;
  * Avoid altering the fundamental character of any song included in Twitch Sings; and
  * Behave (in rock parlance: don’t trash the hotel room).  Conduct yourself in accordance with the Community Guidelines and these Terms of Service.

To make available musical works from a variety of artists within Twitch Sings
(from rock to pop), Twitch negotiated licenses with many different rights
holders and continues to do so in order to add new musical tracks.  The
licenses granted to Twitch allow Twitch to use the works, and offer them to
you for use, solely in connection with Twitch Sings and the Twitch Services.
Twitch Sings content has not been cleared for use outside the Twitch Services.
What this means is that, in your new rock-n-roll lifestyle, do not:

  * make unauthorized use of the copyrighted elements of a Twitch Sings song (including the use of the story of a song in another creative work);
  * assert copyright ownership of the songs (or any arrangements of the songs) provided in Twitch Sings; or
  * use your performance from Twitch Sings outside the Twitch Services, with the exception that you can use the YouTube exporter tool offered on Twitch.  However, you may not exercise any rights to claim or monetize any exported content, or block, dispute, interfere with, or suppress any attempts by a music rights holder (such as a music publisher who controls the song you recorded) to claim or monetize the exported content.

Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement
from rights holders and their agents.  
  
Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over
time.  Thus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other
content from Twitch Sings at any time (for example, as necessary to comply
with our music licenses or with applicable laws). This may mean that Twitch
will be required to take down previously recorded performances. Twitch takes
no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of
Twitch Sings.
