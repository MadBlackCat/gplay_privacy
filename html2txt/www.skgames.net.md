3\. WHY WE COLLECT INFORMATION ABOUT YOU

a) To provide our Games to you  
We will use information about you (including Basic Information, Third Party
Log In Information, Analytics and User Content) for delivering our Games to
you under the terms of use agreed between us. The processing of information in
this way is necessary for us to record your progress and current status within
a Game, and to ensure the Games deliver the features promised and function
properly, so that you have the best experience when playing any one of our
Games.

b) To help us improve the Online Services and fix any problems  
We may process information about you (including Basic Information, User
Content and Analytics) so that we can analyse and improve our Games and Online
Services.  
This processing is also necessary for us to pursue our legitimate interests of
(i) ensuring that our Online Services function properly so that you and other
users have the best experience when playing any of our Game(s) and using the
other Online Services; (ii) improving the quality of our Online Services, and
providing a better experience to our users; (iii) identifying and correcting
any bugs in the Games and Online Services and iv) understanding the
effectiveness of our marketing to attract new users and re-engage our current
users at an aggregated level.

d) To acquire new users and engage current users  
We may process information (including some Advertising Data and Analytics) to
encourage engagement from our less active users and to notify them with new
virtual items or other promotions on offer.  
We may also process this information to pursue our legitimate interests of
acquiring new users for our Games.  
We use various forms of marketing to acquire new users. The information we
collect about you may be used to improve the relevancy of our marketing,
including the creation of ‘lookalike’ audiences. This allows us to offer more
relevant marketing to potential new service users without using information
that personally identifies you.

e) To improve the monetisation of the Games via in-app purchases  
We may process information (including Basic Information, User Content,
Advertising Data and Analytics) to understand how users use our Games, and to
compile statistical reports regarding that activity, as well as understanding
how users progress, and their current status within a Game. This processing is
necessary for us to pursue our legitimate interests of improving the Games and
increasing the amount of revenue generated via in-app purchases. This may
include the implementation of dynamic pricing models, so that in-app purchases
are priced according to relevant factors, such as geography and gameplay
progression so that we can offer temporary promotional discounts.

f) For advertising purposes  
We may process Advertising Data to show you advertisements for third party
services; including advertising that may reward you with benefits during your
use of the Games.  
The information we collect about you may be used to understand how
advertisements placed in our Games have performed or how many people have
viewed certain advertisements. We aggregate this information so that it does
not personally identify you or permit you to be treated individually.  
We may also use this information to reward users with benefits that can be
used for further enjoyment of the Games from the viewing of certain
advertising placed in our Games.  
We will not pass or process your information for the purposes of marketing by
third parties unless you give your consent should we ask for it. After you
have given your consent, you may withdraw it at any time.  
We may use the information we collect about you to serve you targeted
advertisements in our Games. We do this to provide you with more relevant
advertising content. We work with the following third party advertising
networks :

• Adcolony – https://www.adcolony.com/privacy-policy/

g) To prevent fraud and illegal activity  
We process personal data for our legitimate interests of ensuring that any use
of the Online Services is lawful and non-fraudulent, does not disrupt the
operation of our services, does not harass our staff or other individuals, to
enforce our legal rights and to comply with our legal obligations.  
Where we reasonably believe that you are or may be in breach of any applicable
laws or our terms of use, we may use your personal information to inform
relevant third parties such as your law enforcement agencies about the
content.  
We reserve the right to disclose your identity to any third party who is
claiming that any User Content posted by you constitutes a violation of their
intellectual property rights, or of their right to privacy. You may not copy,
download, or embed any User Content without the express written permission of
the content owner. You may not use any User Content for any commercial
purposes, or any public performances.  
We work with Apple and Google to assist us with fraud prevention and the
detection of any illegal activity (e.g. to verify in-app purchases made
through iTunes and Google Play).

4\. DATA SHARING  
We will share your information with third parties only in the ways that are
described in this Privacy Policy

Group members, personnel, suppliers or subcontractors: We keep your
information confidential, but may disclose it to any member of our group
(which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its
subsidiaries, as defined in section 1159 of the Companies Act 2006), our
personnel, suppliers or subcontractors insofar as it is reasonably necessary
for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. However, this is on the basis
that they do not make independent use of the information, and have agreed to
safeguard it.  
Merger or acquisition: If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of
all or a portion of its assets, any third party to which we sell or transfer
our assets to will have the right to continue to use the personal and other
information that you provide us in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy.  
Required by law: In addition, we may disclose your information to the extent
that we are required to do so by law (which may include to government bodies
and law enforcement agencies); in connection with any legal proceedings or
prospective legal proceedings; and in order to establish, exercise or defend
our legal rights (including providing information to others for the purposes
of fraud prevention).  
Enforcement: We may also disclose your personal information to third parties
in order to enforce or apply the terms of agreements, to investigate potential
breaches, or to protect the rights, property or safety of SKG, our customers,
or others.  
Digital Content Stores: Where the Games are downloaded through Google Play,
iTunes and/or Amazon Appstore, we may disclose your personal information to
Google, Apple and/or Amazon respectively for the purposes of facilitating any
in-Game payments made through these platforms.

5\. AUTOMATED DECISION MAKING  
We may use automated decision making methods which do not involve human
involvement to process your information only in the ways that are described in
this Privacy Policy  
We may process your personal information via automated decision making methods
in order to identify users who are suspected of cheating in the Games. Our
automated decision making methods are designed to detect cheating by looking
out for (i) excessive currency stores against actual completed gameplay; and
(ii) excessive content against actual purchases made and completed gameplay.  
If users are determined to be or suspected of cheating the following actions
may be taken and which will be unknown to the user:  
• an increase in the number of advertisements displayed within the Games; and  
• an increase in the frequency of suspected cheats playing against other
suspected cheats.  
We may block users from the Games and/or the Online Services who are
determined to be cheating following an automated decision process. In this
scenario the user will be notified of the outcome and will have the right to
obtain human intervention to express his or her point of view and to contest
the decision to block access to the Games and/or the Online Services.

6\. CONSUMER CONTROL AND OPT-OUT OPTIONS  
If you do not wish to be part of a lookalike campaign, receive notifications
from us or be served with targeted advertisements you can opt-out by changing
your advertising and notification settings on your device directly.  
You can withdraw your consent to targeted advertising by changing your
advertising settings on your device at any time.
